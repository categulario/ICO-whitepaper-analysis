Plutus White Paper
https://plutus.it
June 30, 2016
v1.1
Introduction
The Plutus Mobile Application enables a user to make contactless Bitcoin payments at any merchant
with a Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled checkout terminal. This is the most practical way to pay
with Bitcoin, because the payment process consists only of holding a mobile device above the merchants
NFC reader. As a result, Bitcoin payments are effectively accepted by proxy at over 32 million brick and
mortar merchants around the world.
The primary purpose of Plutus is to provide incentive for, and enable, the practical day-to-day usage of
Bitcoin; ultimately accelerating mass-consumer adoption.
The competitive advantage of Plutus, within the mobile payments industry, is the effective utilization of the rapidly expanding Ethereum network. Through a transparent and decentralized network
protocol, underwritten by distributed ledger technology (the blockchain), Ethereum allows Plutus to deploy smart contracts to enable secure, peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of fiat currency and Bitcoin, with the
added benefit of automatic escrow. Using these methods, the Plutus Decentralized Exchange Network
(PlutusDEX) of traders convert Bitcoin deposits into a prepaid debit balance that is valid at any contactless point-of-sale (POS) terminal.
The philosophy of the application itself is open, inclusive and committed to the network health and
widespread usage of Bitcoin. As such, a public trading API will be available, and 3rd party development
is encouraged.

The Plutus Mobile App (Figure 5) connects users directly to PlutusDEX traders on the Ethereum network. Using the Plutus internal server, the Bitcoin
network can be reached using the native Bitcoin API,
which is connected to via the Java API (ethereumj),
or alternatively, the Javascript API (web3).

Plutus Payment Process

The Plutus payment process (Figure 6) consists of
two main actions:
1. The Plutus Mobile App initiates a wireless payment to the merchants NFC-enabled payment
terminal through the user’s NFC-enabled smartphone.

The Plutus Mobile App enables the user to choose
among a selection of different fiat currencies. A virtual debit card account can be created in GBP, USD,
or EUR, allowing the user to have multiple payment
options.

2. The users VDC payment authorization is sent to
the merchants payment processor, and once approved, the funds are deposited to the merchants

assets to fiat currency in nearly an instant.

Pluton Token Infrastructure
2.4.1

Plutons are the internal digital asset of Plutus and
are issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Pluton transactions can be sent and received using the Plutus
Mobile App, similarly to Bitcoin. Plutons have the
added benefit of zero transaction fees, as well as instant transaction confirmations.

Pluton Rebate System

Plutus Mobile App users are rewarded with a rebate,
at a predetermined rate, of Plutons for every Bitcointo-fiat exchange they make in order to fill their VDC
balance. Plutons can be exchanged for fiat currency
that is then instantly credited to the users contactless balance. There is no rebate reward given for exchanges of Pluton and fiat currencies.

Ownership of Plutons is tied to an Ethereum account. Pluton token source code — running on the
production Ethereum network (networkid 1) — acts
as a decentralized and distributed ledger of all Pluton transactions and the addressed location of every
Pluton. The benefits of using Ethereums blockchain
is its reliability, underwritten by Ethereums built-in
incentives for securing the blockchain. This ensures
the continuity, integrity and security of the Pluton
ledger.

The Pluton Rebate System (Figure 7) is implemented
on the Ethereum network and regulated by the DEX.
Plutons received as rebate rewards are distributed automatically by the DEX to Plutus Mobile App users.

There will be 20,000,000 total Plutons in existence.
As the trading begins for Plutons on the DEX network, the exchange rate, EP , will fluctuate according
to market conditions. Its general equation can be

where Tt represents the current amount of British
Pounds required to purchase one Bitcoin as dictated
by the market.

Bid orders for Plutons are made via the trading frontend. The PlutusDEX trading API will be open
source. It will enable the participation of users on
the DEX network once they have been verified on
the frontend.

Let Ti symbolize a single transaction by a single user,
worth no more than a maximum value of £30. Multiplying Ti by equation (1) yields the Bitcoin value,
Bi , of the given transaction,

Users can buy Plutons, as well as Bitcoin, using the
DEX. Plutons earned via rebates can be transferred
on the blockchain and have no restrictions on use with
in the payment system. Users can transfer Plutons to
other users or trade them for fiat currency, which is
sent to the users VDC balance for in-store purchases.
Plutons are implemented as a Transferable Fungibles

Ethereum API.

Pluton transactions using a wallet that supports
the transferable fungibles standard, through the

• VDC gateway connects to the Plutus app.
– VDC providers API enables users to generate a single virtual debit card token for each
selected currency (GBP, USD & EUR).
– A Plutus app account only allows one VDC
account per currency. Each new deposit
will be added to the same VDC account.

• Plutus Issuer Contract: Regulates the amount
of Plutons issued as rebate rewards for Plutus
users. The contract uses the process detailed in
Section 2.4.1. Rewards are based on the amount
of Bitcoin that a user trades for fiat currency
each day. Only Plutus central can issue rebates.

• VDC gateway connection to NFC device.
– Plutus app user initiates a purchase cycle,
by contacting the merchants NFC-enabled
POS terminal (contactless card reader).

• Name Registry Contract: Holds the addresses
of all active Plutus smart contracts, and allows
other smart contracts to call it to return specific addresses on the Ethereum blockchain. See
namereg.sol for example code.

– The mobile devices built-in NFC capability is used to send the VDC tokenauthorization code to the merchants payment processor or bank.
