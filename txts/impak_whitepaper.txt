Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

1. Introduction
The ICO for the impak Coin (MPK), a new cryptocurrency with a social purpose, will fund the
development of impak.eco, an online social network 100% dedicated to the Impact Economy.
This fast growing segment of the general economy is composed of organizations and individuals
that share the belief that economic activity should consider more than just its financial aspects,
but also take into account the effect it has on people and the planet.
impak Finance Inc. is the entity designing and developing impak.eco. Its plans also include the
creation of a new digital Canadian Bank 100% dedicated to the Impact Economy that would be
placed at the centre of the ecosystem and act as an agent of economic growth within this space.
At its core, this project proposes to radically change the way people experience their relationship
with money by proposing a unique place where investors, companies and individuals exchange
with each other with the understanding that each dollar has the purpose to do good. impak.eco
shares features found on social networks and in disruptive fintech applications and aims to
become that place one comes back to on a daily basis. With the focus being on the growth of the
Impact Economy, every money transaction, whether it is banking, investing, selling or buying
value-aligned responsible products & services, is done with the transparency one would expect in
a changing world where the power of capital resides not only in the hands of the few, but also in
the hands of the many. And where the power of capital serves values that make the world a
better place.
This new cryptocurrency, impak Coin, is unique because it is one of the only digital currencies
with a social purpose. Traditionally, complementary currencies have been created to promote and
sustain local economies, sometimes in the service of social and environmental values. impak
Coin is their modern version, amped up because of its capacity to support locally-rooted
initiatives and to marshal the forces of a global community of people that are willing to combine
the power of capital and technology to change the world. impak Coin will harness that power and
use it to sustain and grow the impak.eco social network, and consequently, the Impact Economy.

2. Executive Summary
2.1

impak Finance

impak Finance Inc. is a start-up on course to create a new, completely digital Canadian
Schedule 1 Bank dedicated solely to the Impact Economy. At the centre of its value proposition is
a plan to radically change the way people and companies do their banking by putting the Bank at
the centre of a social network (impak.eco) that will connect Investors, Companies and Retail
Customers.
The choice of a Bank as the principal instrument of growth for the impact space is motivated by
several factors:

2.2

•

The unique power to grow the money supply a bank possesses by virtue of fractionalreserve banking.

•

The opportunity to create a financial institution that is truly centred on the real economy
and its role as an agent of economic development, rather than focused on speculation
on financial markets as a means to enhance its return to investors.

•

The disruption potential that fintech firms provide in the building of a banking experience
that is in line with expectations and values of millennials and other like-minded strata of
society.

impak.eco

The impak.eco social network will be launched at the end of 2017, prior to the Bank. impak.eco
aims to bring structure to a very fragmented space: the Impact Economy – where even
experienced investors have very poor visibility over companies that would represent sound
investment opportunities because of: (i) a lack of intermediaries specialized in seeking out impact
companies and qualifying them and (ii) the absence of a coherent and recognized way to
measure the level of impact of these companies so that investors can make an informed decision.
Likewise, entrepreneurs in the impact space looking for capital have very few options when it
comes to finding value-aligned investors and have no platform dedicated to their space onto
which they could put forth the qualities that make them interesting investment opportunities.
One of the main objectives of the social network is to give a voice to every Citizen wishing to use
her money as a force for good. Today, impact investment is mostly reserved to institutions and
accredited investors. With impak.eco, Citizens will be able to identify impact merchants and have
access to products and services aligned with their values. They will be able to actively participate
in transforming the world every day by responsibly choosing which companies their money will
support.
The reunion of like-minded Investors, Businesses and Citizens in the ecosystem is the basis for a
true, transactional social network dedicated to the Impact Economy. The abundance in the
marketplace of sophisticated applications, whether from fintechs or other providers, allows for the
creation of a service offering that will result in a truly habit-forming experience.

2.3

The impak Scorecard

The impak Scorecard is the criteria by which all companies on the social network will be judged
on their level of impact. Every merchant on impak.eco will have been pre-accredited by going
through an online filter system (impak Scorecard). As such it is the central element in how
choices will be made both by investors looking at investment opportunities and retail customers
looking for value aligned businesses to provide them with the products and services they seek.
It is derived from the evaluation of a company’s performance in four areas: Governance, Wellbeing of Employees and Community, Environment and Economic Sustainability.

2.4

impak Coin

impak Coin is the cryptocurrency impak Finance will issue. It is the first digital currency of its kind
completely dedicated to the Impact Economy. impak Coin will possess features that make its use
advantageous - alongside the national currency - within impak.eco, thus promoting the growth of
this space.
The impak Coin launch is based on the combination of three movements that gained worldwide
momentum in the last decade:
•

Complementary currencies

•

Impact Economy

•

Cryptocurrencies (Blockchain)

2.4.1

The power of complementary (local) currencies:

•

Complementary currencies (CCs) have been proposed as a means to stimulate local
economies, reduce unemployment, and promote cooperative and sustainable community
development. They aim to protect, stimulate or orientate the economy

•

They may also be used to advance particular social, environmental, or political goals.

•

There has been an explosion in the number of CCs in existence in the last decade. There
are now well over 5,000 such currencies worldwide.

•

The major factors identified as limiting the success of real CCs are the lack of major
institutional buy-in and structural features about the currencies’ designs that limit their
volume of transactions.1

2.4.2

The Worldwide Growth of the Impact Economy

Doing good while doing well. That is the mission of impact businesses and investors, who
combine the desire to address a social problem with wealth creation.
The Impact Economy is a new market force underpinned by companies, entrepreneurs and
investors that have the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a

financial return. Impact entrepreneurs are pursuing business opportunities that will both generate
profit and address endemic social problems.
The growing impact investment market provides capital to address the world’s most pressing
challenges in sectors such as sustainable food and agriculture, renewable energy, conservation,
microfinance, and affordable and accessible basic services including housing, healthcare, and
education. With a rapidly expanding market and an increasing number of participants, the idea of
“impact” as an economic force has hit the mainstream.
According to Purpose Capital, a consultancy firm specialized in impact investment, Canadian
investment in that space surpassed the $60 billion mark in 2015 and will reach over $500 billion
in the next 10 years.
Increasing amounts of capital are flowing into the Impact Economy. In 2012, the Calvert
Foundation formed an estimate through a representative survey of investment managers,
applying prospective adoption rates to a global investment management industry of
US$ 26 trillion, and reached a market potential of US$ 650 billion.
th

On April 17 2017, the Ford Foundation committed to invest US$1 billion in the Impact Economy.
According to the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), an industry group that tracks market
trends, impact investment has grown in size from US$15 billion two years ago to more than
US$77 billion in 2016.

2.4.3

The Decentralized Collaborative Power of Cryptocurrencies

If you take away all the noise around cryptocurrency and reduce it to a simple definition, they
are simply entries in a database that no one can change without fulfilling specific conditions.
This may seem pedestrian, but, believe it or not: it is exactly how you can define currency.
Take the money in your bank account: aren’t they just entries in a database that can only be
changed under specific conditions? Take physical coins and notes. What are they, if not entries
in a public physical database that can only be changed if you match the condition that you
physically own the coins and notes? Money is all about a verified entry in some kind of database
of accounts, balances, and transactions.
In other words, the technology supporting Bitcoin – the mother of all cryptocurrencies - is a
decentralized network of peers keeping a consensus about accounts and balances. Some say it
is more of a currency than the numbers you see in your bank account - numbers that are no more
than entries in a private database that are managed by people you don’t see and by rules you
don’t know.
Cryptocurrencies are entries about tokens (coins) in decentralized consensus-databases. They
are called cryptocurrencies because the consensus-keeping process is secured by strong
cryptography. Cryptocurrencies are built on cryptography. They are not secured by people or by
trust, but by math/software. The probability of an asteroid falling on your house is higher than that
of a bitcoin address being compromised.
The three main issues cryptocurrencies solve are:
1. National currency creation is based on debt creation. Most cryptocurrencies are rather
created through value creation.
2. Banks are the creators of national currency supplies. Cryptocurrencies are owned and
controlled by the communities that use them.

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

3. Most banks invest their liquidities based on no other value other than profit
maximization. Cryptocurrencies are created to support specific projects. In our case,
impak Coin (MPK) supports a project with a clear societal and environmental purpose.

2.5

Having the Courage to Change the World

Innovation is scary. But this doesn’t change the fact that cryptocurrencies are here to stay – and
here to change the world. This is already happening.
We see an increasing number of companies across a variety of industries making the first
tentative steps in blockchain adoption. They are realising that there is a pressing need to get
ahead of the curve and beat the competition. Primary interest in the sector is coming from tech
giants (Microsoft, IBM, Amazon) and major Wall Street banks (JPMorgan, Citigroup), with
companies such as Infosys, TCS and HCL reportedly working on blockchain-based products to
support the financial industry. R3 was the first blockchain company in the financial sector;
founded in 2014 it now leads a consortium of more than 70 of the world’s biggest financial
institutions and working on a variety of projects that it is rapidly patenting.
Meanwhile, the demand for blockchain technology in finance and financial services is growing on
a worldwide scale, primarily in the developing world. A multitude of economies within Latin
America, Southeast Asia and Africa have strict currency control laws and are seeing consumers
flock towards alternatives to mainstream financial institutions. People who have no bank account,
simply to use alternative financial services, are activating over 1 million smartphones a month.
In terms of entrepreneurial ventures, we have also seen a clear trend emerge in the last few
years. Broadly speaking, 2015 was the year when financial institutions and fintech start-ups
discovered blockchain technology. 2016 was then the year of pilots and first deployments.
Following on this trend, we project that 2017 will be the year when blockchain enterprise solutions
leave the pilot phase and proceed to commercialization and wide-scale adoption.
As we can observe, the large majority of blockchain initiatives are developed within the same
economic mind frame of profit maximisation. We believe that the intrinsic characteristics and
innovations of cryptocurrencies can be leveraged in order to have a positive social impact on our
world. This is at the center of the impak Project.

Cryptocurrencies are changing the world. They can also have a positive social
impact. You can either stand beside and observe – or you can become part of
history in the making.

3. The Business of impak Finance
3.1

Structure

Impak Finance was incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act on May 5, 2016.
The head and principal office of the Corporation is located at 2700 – 1000 Sherbrooke Street
West, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 3G4. The registered and records office of the Corporation
is located at 2700 – 1000 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 3G4.
The Corporation does not have any subsidiaries. The Corporation’s financial year-end is
December 31.

3.1.1

Voting Trust and Restrictions on Transfer Agreement

Shareholders of the Common Shares are expected to be subject to the Voting Trust and
Restriction on Transfer Agreement (the “Voting Trust Agreement”) dated August 9. 2016
pursuant to which Paul Allard, Bill Young and Marguerite Mendell (collectively, the “Voting
Trustees”) have been granted voting control over such Common Shares. Decisions of the Voting
Trustees shall be made by simple majority of the Voting Trustees. Pursuant to the Voting Trust
Agreement, Shareholders of the Common Shares agree not to transfer any of the Common
Shares before the earliest of (i) the Corporation having enabled an over-the-counter market for
the Common Shares, and (ii) December 31, 2019. As per the Voting Trust Agreement, the
directors of the Corporation might approve transfers between related parties but the only other
authorised transfers shall be offered through an over-the-counter market organised and
maintained by Impak Finance (“OTC”). Rules governing the OTC transfers shall be adopted by
the Trustees and are likely to include that the Common Shares will be tradable during predetermined periods of time at a pre-determined price equal to the fair market value thereof as
determined by independent evaluators retained and paid by Impak Finance and that ownership of
any person or group of related persons or acting in concert will be limited to 9.99% of the
outstanding Common Shares of Impak Finance. The board of directors of Impak Finance might
also retain the right to refuse the transfer of Common Shares to buyers that are not in compliance
with the mission and the vision of Impak Finance (for example, criminal groups with an history of
money laundering or non-resident investors not able to demonstrate acceptable source of funds
could be refused).

3.1.2

Corporate governance

In order to mitigate potential conflicting interests of shareholders, members, management and
employees of Impak Finance, the Trustees will exercise the voting rights granted to them under
the Voting Trust Agreement as to encompass corporate governance rules dealing specifically
with the election of the directors of Impak Finance. It is anticipated that a certain number of board
seats will be elected by different categories of stakeholders, including, without limitation, the
Trustees, the management of the Corporation, the employees of the Corporation, the clients of
the Corporation (as the case may be) and the civil society. To achieve these purposes, it is
anticipated that the Voting Trust arrangement will gradually be replaced by other mechanics to
ensure as much as possible the protection of the mission and of the vision of Impak Finance,
which might include the use of a non-for-profit foundation.

Citizens’ knowledge, skills and purchasing power, impak.eco is giving them a voice and the
power to better the world around them and allow them to contribute to its sustainability.
The social network also will bring structure to a very fragmented space: the Impact Economy –
where even experienced investors have very poor visibility over companies that would represent
sound investment opportunities because of: (i) a lack of intermediaries specialized in seeking out
impact companies and qualifying them and (ii) the absence of a coherent and recognized way to
measure the level of impact of these companies so that investors can make an informed decision.
Likewise, entrepreneurs and organizations in the impact space seeking capital and sales have
very few options when it comes to finding value-aligned investors and customers. They have no
platform dedicated to the social impact space onto which they could put forth the qualities that
make them attractive impact investment opportunities and recognized impactful products and
services for responsible consumers.
The reunion of like-minded Investors, Businesses and Citizens on impak.eco is the basis for a
true, transactional social network dedicated to the Impact Economy. The abundance in the
marketplace of sophisticated features, whether from fintechs or other providers allows for the
creation of a unique user experience that will result in a truly positive habit-forming experience.

3.2.2

The current models of social networks

In Finance
The concept of social network is often brought forth in the fintech and banking industries. It
usually represents a combination of stakeholders and technology platforms helping financial
institutions map their processes and identify influencers. However, in most cases, it offers little or
no empowerment to its participants. Financial institutions use a top-down approach to improve
their performance and other stakeholders have very little say in the social network’s interactions
or composition.

In Technology
From a technology standpoint, the past years have seen the rise of several social networks built
by major players. LinkedIn, Facebook, and Angel List are all great examples of technology-based
social networks claiming to use technology to forward business and social interaction. At first
glance, they seem to offer a valid value proposition and have all built great tools to empower their
communities: newsfeeds, walls, messaging, notifications, geolocation, etc.
However, the plot thickens from a key driver’s perspective. Most of these social networks have
been designed to use these tools to sell advertising. The tools, user experience and algorithms
are created to bolster very simplistic metrics: number of people coming to the site, time spent on
the site and visit recurrence, and that for one single goal: to profit from advertising sales. The
more eyes on the site, the longer they look at it, the more profitable the provider can be at selling
advertisements. This therefore creates a strong bias against the macro objectives they put forth
in bettering society and the economy.

3.2.3

The impak Finance Approach

impak Finance’s approach is in fact different. The development of the impak.eco social network is
done using a human-centered design methodology: a creative approach to interactive systems
development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, designing
around their needs and requirements at all stages, and by applying human factors/ergonomics,
usability knowledge, and techniques. This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency,
improves human well-being, user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability.
Throughout every phase of development, the target users help co-create and are strongly
involved in steering the project. The design team has already done workshops with over 400
businesses and 500 individuals throughout Canada and keeps the co-creation momentum going
with the involvement of its 1000 retail investors and stakeholders. The design team works with
the stakeholders it plans to serve.
Moreover, in line with impak Finance’s core values, this approach is used to empower its users
and reach the goal of growing the Impact Economy. The systems and technology are designed
from a bottom-up perspective and establish impak Finance’s role as a facilitator and a catalyst
towards economic growth.
Finally, impak Finance’s technological development philosophy is to build products and services
where an actual added value can be measured. This opens the possibility of unique
collaborations with a variety of ventures and projects both in fintech and social realm.

3.2.4

Purpose is our Key Driver

The key driver behind impak Finance’s social network is the growth of the Impact Economy. Its
bias is to design tools, calibrate algorithms and refine the user experience to foster the
sustainability of a real economy based on bettering society and the environment.
Nowadays, we often interrogate ourselves about the true purpose behind information or the tools
provided to us on a social platform. Imagine if we built a new platform that truly led to the
empowerment of oneself or their business. Trusting the key drivers behind a system is imperative
to impak Finance.
Empowerment is at the heart of the impak Finance’s project. We are building a financial institution
that espouses that value and in this world, we believe that it is a competitive advantage.

3.2.5

The impak Finance social network

At a grassroots level, this social network involves real businesses, real people and other
stakeholders of the real economy. Technology is a tool to meet their needs, but even in its
absence, the ecosystem has to be sustainable.
Stakeholders are closely involved in the development of all impak products and services. The
social network that is currently being built is a technological platform designed to favour the
Impact Economy by facilitating interactions between 3 main stakeholder categories:
(i)

Impact Organisations (businesses, NGOs, Non-for-Profits, social enterprises)
which main intention is to better the society and the environment through a
sustainable business model;

(ii)

Citizens/Retail Customers seeking to have a positive impact by putting their
money to work according to their values; and

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

(iii)

Capital Partners (VC, Angel Investors, Family Offices, Foundations, Pension Funds,
other Institutional Investors) seeking returns with a purpose,

In simple terms, impak.eco social network is akin to a merger between Facebook, Angel List and
LinkedIn into one single platform using the current state of their technology to better the Impact
Economy instead of selling ads.

3.2.6

The Power of the Triad

The current platforms available on the market often only recognize the relationship between 2
stakeholders: retail customers and organisations, businesses and investors, etc. The impak
social network is designed to leverage the power of 3.
First and foremost, the underlying design principle is that whether they are businesses, venture
capital firms or another legal entity, the users on the platform are people first. A user can
potentially be a business owner, an investor and a retail customer at the same time. This entails
the creation of unique tool built to leverage all aspects of one’s actions in support of the Impact
Economy within the ecosystem.
Secondly, the enrolment mechanisms will ensure that all of one’s contribution in the growth of the
Impact Economy is taken into account from the outset. Hence, a large part of the initial Retail
Customers/Citizens group will go through a series of processes, such as KYC (Know-YourCustomer). For all stakeholders, the design team has planned a friction-less enrolment
mechanism that outlines how, other than financially, individuals can use their knowledge and
skills to grow the Impact Economy.
Thirdly, a series of validation processes (such as BCorp evaluation, community based validation,
impak Scorecard or due diligence verification) will guarantee that any business present in
impak.eco will be a positive social impact organisation. Most see these processes as friction
points in their systems and try to bypass them to rapidly reach critical mass. impak Finance,
however, sees this as an opportunity to offer a wider range of tools that take advantage of the
knowledge and skills base stakeholders bring by their presence in impak.eco.
For example, if a retail customer were a retired business owner in bioscience, his vote or “like” of
a business in that particular sector would carry weight and credibility. This may also open the
door to a mentoring relationship with the business owner. With these mechanisms in play, a
potential investor would see that this business benefits from support, which could in turn
positively affect his risk analysis.
The impak.eco design, by considering this triad in its development, is leveraging a larger set of
data to grow the Impact Economy.

3.2.7

Stakeholders’ Point of View

Citizens/Retail Customers
By participating in impak.eco, Retail Customers/Citizens have a voice in supporting the Impact
Economy and are searching for a way to play a role in improving our environment and society.
They are much more than just a wallet or a potential transaction in a system and need to be
recognized for all the attributes they bring.
The impak social network aims to help Retail Customers/Citizens reach two main goals: (i) easing
the process to purchase or invest in the Impact Economy and (ii) empowering themselves as
promoters of growth the Impact Economy, in ways other than their economic activity.

Impact Organisations/Merchants
Positive Impact organisations’ core mission embodies their intention to improve the environment
and society through a sustainable business model. Those positive impact organizations will
become Accredited Merchants and will be allowed on the ecosystem after being vetted through a
process involving both the community and impak Finance accreditation filter (impak Scorecard).
This ensures that the quality of the data in the system remains high, noise-free and impactfocussed.
impak.eco aims to do two things in support of the organisations/businesses: help them raise
capital and generate sales.

Capital Partners
Capital partners are impact investors and want to invest in the Impact Economy. Impact investing
is rapidly growing, worldwide. However, the current lack of unified impact standards and the lack
of visibility on investment opportunities is a major obstacle to the flow of capital and the growth of
the sector.
impak.eco aims to help Capital Partners reach two main goals: have easy access to a curated
deal flow and facilitate the impact investment process.

3.2.8

impak Coin and impak.eco

impak Coin and impak.eco have a symbiotic relationship. impak Coin is an important growth
vector for the Impact Economy within the social network, bringing on one hand a sense of
purpose and belonging through the execution of transactions in the impact space, and on the
other hand relieving the friction one finds in usual transactional mechanisms (e.g. transactional
fees).
impak.eco brings impak Coin legitimacy and integrity through its rigor and impact validation
mechanisms (impak Score Card). But it also establishes protocols to provide a valuation system
for impak Coin.

3.2.9

Scalability - from Canada to worldwide growth

Act local, think global, they say! The success of an ecosystem relies heavily on the path to critical
mass, i.e. obtaining enough actors in the system to generate an optimal level of interactions
toward the main drivers – in the case of impak.eco: toward the growth of the Impact Economy.
This is therefore the underlying principle governing the scalability of the system. The impak social
network aims to scale on 2 main levels: Sectors and Geolocation. In order to scale properly,
critical mass needs to be first achieved in one specific sector or geolocation to demonstrate its
value before moving to a new one.
A good example for this principle is how Facebook has scaled and reached critical mass through
university campuses before going live to all users across the world.
For impak.eco, this will be done by launching in the Canadian market where the Impact Economy
is rapidly growing and where a strong network of businesses, community players and investors
are supporting impak Finance. Let’s not forget that at the heart of impak.eco lie real people and
real organisations that have been rallied to the project to co-create as well as scale. In recent
history, the success of digital social platforms has shown to be in direct relationship to the real
interactions between entities. The understanding of interactions in the communities of the
physical world remains a fundamental aspect of scaling impak.eco. That is why impak Finance is
also working closely with groups and individuals in the impact space to achieve critical mass.
Also, a series of partnerships are currently being established with other financial institutions, such
as members of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values or certification mechanisms like BCorp, to allow the platform to scale globally while acting locally. It is of utmost importance for
impak.eco to decentralize its growth and allow for diversity in its scaling process. It is through this
process that we will be able to show the power of the decorrelation of the Impact Economy to a
country’s while correlating it to growth based on shared values and sustainability.

3.2.10 The impak Scorecard
The impak Scorecard is the criteria by which all companies on the impak.eco will be judged on
their level of impact and will become accredited Merchants. As such, it is the central element in
how choices will be made both by investors looking at investment opportunities and retail
customers looking for value aligned businesses to provide them with the products and services
they seek.
The impak Scorecard criteria are based on the 17 UN Sustainable Objectives. The criteria cover
Governance, the well being of Employees and the Community, the Environment and the business
model.

5. Building impak Coin (MPK)
5.1

Summary

Blockchain technology has been evolving at an unmatched pace. Some of these innovative
features have been integrated within the original Bitcoin blockchain while some others have been
integrated to brand new chains of altcoins. There are hundreds of new altcoins created every
year, many with the purpose of proving these new innovative features.
impak Coin is one of them. impak Coin is a cryptocurrency built on blockchain technology. It is
centrally governed by a governing body established by impak Finance and shares its values of
transparency, stability and purpose. impak Coin is meant to fuel the green, socially responsible
and the local economies all around the globe. Anyone using the network will be validated during a
mandatory onboarding process in order to truly have a community that shares our values.
One major innovative point with impak Coin is its stability. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, it will not
be traded on exchanges (markets), but rather on a dedicated market managed by impak Finance,
and at a pre-established price point. This way, impak Coin will be stable in value, contrary to the
usual offer and demand models.
impak Coin is part of a new movement called “Blockchain 2.0”. which improves upon existing
Blockchain infrastructure to support more efficient cryptocurrencies. In other words, this approach
promotes the usage of meta-cryptocurrencies and meta-blockchain. In the impak Coin’s case,
the underlying network is the WAVES Blockchain.
impak Coin aims to stimulate, to retain, to attract and to orientate capital towards the impact
economy, hence promoting its growth. Therefore, impak Coin will encourage participating
members to put their buying power at each other's disposal and keep it circulating within the
Impact Economy, thereby providing impact enterprises with additional sales volume and loyalty.

5.2

What is Blockchain technology?

At its simplest, the blockchain is a digital record stored on a network of computers around the
world. Instead of securing information by restricting access, the blockchain shares information
amongst all users. Ownership of funds (for example) is cryptographically verified, and the full
transparency and mutual ownership of the system means that a bad actor is immediately
recognisable as such and any transactions submitted by such a node are ignored. The
decentralised structure of the blockchain brings several key features in contrast to traditional
centralised approaches:
•

Transparency: it is possible for anyone to track the movement of funds from one
account to another.

•

Immutability: once confirmed, a transaction cannot be reversed. No one can interfere
with a completed transfer.

•

Low cost: transaction fees are minimal.

•

Cross-border: funds can be sent as easily to someone on the other side of the world as
they can to someone in the next room.

5.3
5.3.1

Speed: due to the flat and transparent nature of Blockchain, transfers show up almost
instantly and are typically confirmed in minutes, rather than hours or days.2

Why Blockchain 2.0 and WAVES?
Why Blockchain 2.0

“Since its inception, blockchain technology has been fraught with controversy over its most
natural application – value transfer using the network token. Decentralized money is a
groundbreaking development, but blockchain technology cannot be reduced to this alone. Being
essentially a distributed database, the blockchain allows for various types of distributed ledger
3
entries, the nature of which depends on their interpretation by the blockchain users.”
By entering metadata in the ledger, which are encoded and decoded depending on the needs,
the transactions about a new type of token can be supported by a network that has nothing to do
with the second layer cryptocurrency (or 2.0). Essentially, the second layer ledger is the gathering
of precise fractions of the underlying ledger.
This way, it is possible to create and manage a cryptocurrency without having to support or
develop a Blockchain infrastructure. The main advantages are security and development costs. In
its nature, the more users use and validate (no matter the consensus algorithm) a Blockchain, the
hardest it is the successfully attack. So by leveraging an existing top tier chain/network to host
the metadata of a second layer cryptocurrency, the security is superior than having to develop it
in the first hand. These advantages are comparable with those coming from renting a server in
4
the cloud instead of buying, deploying and maintaining the physical infrastructure.

5.3.2

Why WAVES ?

“WAVES is a decentralized blockchain platform focusing on custom blockchain tokens
5
operations” . Exactly made for second layer tokens, WAVES looked like a perfect match for what
impak Coin envisioned. Digging a little deeper, its PoS consensus model makes it faster and
greener compared to PoW Blockchains. Despite being a relatively young coin, WAVES market
cap of $40M showcases its potential and strong codebase. The project managed to attract a
blasting capital of $16M during the ICO, which is, on par with Ethereum, the largest ICO ever
made.
Serious projects are already leveraging the WAVES blockchain for their own second layer
cryptocurrencies, for example Incent from Australia who raised $1M earlier this year.

5.4

impak Coin (MPK) Blockchain infrastructure

impak Coin is also different by its Blockchain infrastructure. impak Coin is part of the movement
of “Blockchain 2.0”. The philosophy is all about leveraging an existing Blockchain to encode

metadata instead of first layer transactions. As well as a cryptocurrency transaction, a string of
characters on a Blockchain could represent pretty much anything like other digital assets or
securities. That philosophy has enabled new models like Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS). Just
like cloud computing where you can use the infrastructure without owning it and having to
manage it, BaaS let you use a Blockchain without having to maintain the network yourself. In a
way, we can say that impak Coin’s Blockchain is a meta-Blockchain and impak Coin itself is a
meta-cryptocurrency.
The chosen underlying Blockchain for impak Coin is WAVES. WAVES is a PoS Blockchain
forked from Bitcoin with low block time, low fees and is specifically designed for the integration of
second layer assets. Due to its PoS nature, it is a greener alternative than PoW blockchains.

impak Coin (MPK) Abstract Stack

5.5

Anonymity

Every user will have to go through a standard KYC process. Then, every new public key will be
stapled to its owner identity but this record will not be public. Hence there will be a limited
anonymity in the impak Coin network. The fact that any transactions or addresses can be tied to
a physical person eliminates much of the regulatory friction. This system could also enable new
models for regulators and authority where instead of having to push them the information on
transactions, they could pull it from the transparent Blockchain. This would make it less of a
burden for citizens and would benefit authorities since they would have the truth right away.

5.6

Private keys

In the impak Coin-centralized system, private keys are never stored on the client’s device. They
will remain secured within the impak infrastructure. This way, the risks associated with loss or
theft of a private key are all mitigated by impak Finance which eases that burden for its clients.

5.7
5.7.1

Transactions
WAVES Transaction Cost to impak Finance

The transaction fees on the Waves platform are 0.001 WAVES per transaction no matter the size
of the transaction - this fee is paid by impak Finance (as a matter of comparison, 1 WAVES is
approximately $0.37 which means 1000 impak Coin transactions would cost $0.37). impak
Finance is not charging any fees for its infrastructure.

5.7.2

Transaction speed

The transaction speed for impak Coin will be somewhere between 1-20 seconds before the first
confirmation. This is somewhat faster than most other cryptocurrencies. Those speeds are
achieved due to impak Coin being a second layer Blockchain and because of its underlying PoS
model.

5.8

Network Architecture

It is important to understand the entities within the network and how they interact with each other.
There are four main player required for the system to work: Apps servers, MPK core, WAVES
node and the database server.

5.8.1

Apps servers:

Some apps servers may be supported by impak Finance, others will be under the control of the
governance. An example of an application using the MPK is the web wallet, which will be
developed and maintained by impak Finance. In general, all apps will become an integral part of
the ecosystem and should be developed using “User Centered Design” principles. Third party
developers are invited to contribute to the ecosystem by connecting to MPK core API.

5.8.2

MPK core

The MPK core acts as the entry point for any application. It will act as the Blockchain core with
6
traditional calls as well as for internal procedures like onboarding clients and managing money
supply.

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

5.8.3

WAVES node

The WAVES node could be on the same virtual machines as the MPK core. The node will be the
gateway for the core to interact with the actual ledger underlying impak Coin. The WAVES node
could be optional since the interaction could be done with a public WAVES node already on the
network but there could be security issues if the node gets compromised.

5.8.4

Database server

The database server is where the sensitive information will be stored. This is why there should be
extra security measures in place such as an IP whitelist, firewall, encryption of every sensitive
field and more.

5.9
5.9.1

Stability
impak Coin Stable Supply

As impak Coin’s main objective and purpose is to support the growth of the Impact Economy, the
MPK creation mechanism is designed to be correlated with the growth of the transactions value
within impak.eco.
The issuance or revoking of MPKs is made off-chain by the MPK Governance Body. The amount
is determined to reflect the health of the impak.eco community in a way that if it grows, more can
be added and if it shrinks, more can be revoked. One of the factors will be the flow between fiat
and MPKs. To assure transparency at any time, there will be a reserved address for the issuance

© impak Finance inc. 2017

31

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

of MPKs. This will allow to openly disclose at any time the amount of MPKs in circulation and the
moment they were issued.

5.9.2

Stable Market

Although impak Coin will be supported by a fully decentralized blockchain (Waves), the MPK
Governance Body will be the central authority regulating the exchange rate and controlling the
issuance mechanism. The goal being to assure that impak Coin remains a growth catalyst for the
impak.eco Merchants that accepts impak Coin-based transactions. Furthermore, the MPK
Governance Body will have sole responsibility for stabilizing the MPK price. It will do so by setting
the price of the MPK on a quarterly basis and executing market operations as described further in
this document.

5.10 Merchant ecosystem
5.10.1 Merchant service
Every accredited impact businesses and organizations (Accredited Merchants) publishing the
impak Sore Card within impak.eco social network will be granted with an impak Coin merchant
eWallet (the MPK eWallet). The MPK eWallet will allow them to seamlessly accept payments
made in MPK. All MPK transactions made to an Accredited Merchant will be free of charge. This
will foster the circulation of impak Coin within impak.eco.

5.10.2 Customer rewards
Clients are going to be incentivized to spend their impak Coin within impak.eco through a reward
system. Similar to a cash-back system, clients will receive a % of what they spend as new MPK.
The exact percentage will be adjusted from time to time by the MPK Governance Body to
regulate and stabilize the MPK price.

5.11 Malicious Attack Prevention
5.11.1 Unauthorized transactions
It is impossible to eliminate the occurrence of a user account being compromised if someone
steal/guess/hack their password or device. This is why the MPK Governance Body must have a
protocol to contest or reverse illegitimate transactions. The main obstacle, however, is that by
nature the Blockchain ledger is immutable, thus transactions cannot be reversed or canceled.
The first element of the solution is to create a “black hole” address, an MPK eater of which no
one will have the private key. Then an “anti-fraud” address should be created with the sole
purpose of generating new MPKs following the destruction of “dirty”/compromised MPKs.
Now, every time an unauthorized transaction is identified, the whole amount of the transaction will
be sent from the receiver account into the “black hole”. After that, new coins will be generated by
the “anti-fraud” address and will be sent back the to sender of the unauthorized transaction. This
will do two things; first the balances will be in the same state they were before the malicious
transaction. Finally, the “black hole” address will make sure that “dirty”/corrupted coins are never

32

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

in circulation after being identified. This way, every MPK on the network will have a clean history
and it will be possible to easily identify addresses that have been involved with malicious actions.

5.11.2 Private Key Management System Compromised
A system must be in place in the occurrence of a hacker gaining total access to the infrastructure
including the private key management system in which every private key is stored. In the case,
the main concern is to authorize fraudulent withdrawals and transactions. So first thing will be to
block all CAD withdrawals and signal that transactions are disabled. Then, a recovery system will
take care to duplicate valid data onto a brand new Blockchain with their own distinct private/public
keys.
The recovery system will create a new asset on the WAVES network. From this new asset, pair
of keys will be generated for every account registered in the KYC database. Once every key is
regenerated onto the new Blockchain, the recovery system will chronologically duplicate any
transaction made on the compromised Blockchain onto the new one until the point where the
infrastructure has been compromised. Finally, once the new asset is at the desired state, every
key from the old system will be wiped and the MPK core will now be redirected on the new asset
that will become the main impak Coin asset.
Hence, even if the hacker has a duplicate of every keys and enters what he want in the “old”
compromised Blockchain, the old asset will not be recognized by any means as an MPK since
the MPK core will reference the “new” Blockchain.

5.11.3 Cashback System Abuse
To prevent abuse in the cashback system, bonuses will not be drawn directly from the raw
outgoing amount of one’s address. It will be calculated instead from the flow of MPKs between
each individual with which one has transacted with. The flow is basically the difference between
the income and outcome between each pair of individuals. Any overlapping flow between two
users will be deducted from the rewardable outcome. This system makes the abuse of the
cashback system much more difficult, since no matter how many people are involved in the fraud,
only the ones with a positive flow will receive cashback.
One the example below, user C and D have an overlapping flow for of 50 MPK which makes that
50 MPK not eligible for cashback.
For clarity, in each transaction, one of the users must be a an accredited merchant. Transfers of
MPKs between individuals are not permitted.

6. The MPK Crowdsale
6.1

The Impact Economy

The Impact Economy is a new market force underpinned by companies, entrepreneurs and
investors that have the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a
financial return. Impact entrepreneurs are pursuing business opportunities that will both generate
profit and address endemic social problems.

6.2

impak Coin (MPK): the first cryptocurrency with social purpose

impak Coin is the first complementary currency leveraging the power of cryptocurrencies and
blockchain to support and accelerate the growth of the Impact Economy.
•

It is the first crypto currency with a purpose combining the orientation power of
complementary currencies with the decentralized scalability and usability of a
blockchain currency.

•

The way it is designed and coded, impak Coin will be the first stable cryptocurrency
supporting the growth of the Impact Economy. Its value will be initially pegged to the
Canadian Dollar and will be adjusted quarterly by the MPK Governance Body with the
objective of maintaining purchasing power over a set basket of goods and services.

•

impak Coin’s purpose is to encourage participating members to put their buying power
at each other's disposal and keep it circulating within the Impact Economy, thereby
providing impact enterprises with additional sales volume and loyalty.

•

impak Coin may even dampen downturns in the business cycle, helping to stabilize and
grow the Impact Economy during difficult times.

•

The use of impak Coin may result in increased sales, cash flow and profits for Impact
Organizations (Accredited Merchants) within the impak.eco social network.

•

impak Coin is a "coup de force" against the "diversion" by banks of a "public service"
mission: monetary creation and real economy stimulation.

Designed to Accelerate Growth of the Impact Economy

Every accredited impact business and organization (Accredited Merchant) publishing their impak
Scorecard within impak.eco will be granted an MPK merchant eWallet (MPK eWallet). The MPK
eWallet will allow seamless acceptance of payments made in MPK. All impak Coin transactions

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

made to an Accredited Merchant will be free of charge. All other transactions, such as exchange
into other currencies, will have a transaction fee. This will foster the circulation of MPKs within
impak.eco.
Although any merchants (non impak accredited) and individuals will be able to own, accept, buy
and sell MPKs at the listed market price, the cost of selling MPKs will favor the use of MPKs
within impak.eco.
On the other hand, spending cryptocurrencies or fiat money (mostly CAD in the initial deployment
phase) within impak.eco will be rewarded: on each transaction executed with Accredited
Merchants, the buyer will be granted an MPK cash-back representing a % of the transaction. This
cash-back system will be the main currency creation process. (see MPK Supply section 5.9)

6.6

impak Coin Aligns Incentives to Grow the Impact Economy

Imagine a world where merchants could reward customers instantly, with a digital asset that
never expires and appreciates in value. Would you not shop with a merchant who offered such a
powerful reward?
impak Coin represents for its holders access to products and services offered by Accredited
Merchants (businesses and organizations) part of the impak.eco network.
By combining the values of complementary currencies and the power of crypto-currencies, we
believe impak Coin will have an impressive accelerating effect for the Impact Economy by
aligning its users incentives towards the support of this positive economy. Secondly, an Open API
approach will encourage third party developers to add functionalities to the impak Coin
ecosystem bridging to further growth of the network.

6.7

Initial impak Coin (MPK) Supply

The initial amount of MPKs created in this Crowdsale will be a minimum of 575,000 MPK to a
maximum of 11,500,000 MPK. The final number of MPKs issued will be affected by final issuance
based on bonus terms outlined in section 6.3.
In no event will more than 14,375,000 MPKs be issued. This number reflects to the maximum
crowd sale issuance (10,000,000), plus the greatest possible presale bonus (25%), plus the
Governance Body MPK reserve of (15%).

MPK Supply Will be Correlated to the Growth of the Impact Economy

As impak Coin’s main objective and purpose is to support the growth of the Impact Economy, the
MPK creation mechanism was designed to be correlated with the growth of the Impact Economy.
The main MPK creation mechanisms are as follows:

6.8.1

MPK cash-back percentage per transaction*

Most of the impak Coin supply will be created on an ongoing basis each time a transaction in
cryptocurrencies or in FIAT money occurs through an Accredited Merchant MPK eWallet. The
amount of MPKs created will represent a % of the transaction and will be automatically credited
to the buyer’s eWallet at the end of each month. Similar to a cash-back system, the % will be
adjusted from time to time by the MPK Governance Body to regulate and stabilize the MPK price.
The planned schedule of the MPK cash-back % applied during the first year following the impak
Coin launch is:

MPK creation (cash-back%)
schedule
Launch Phase (0-3 months)

10 %

Phase 1 (3-6 months)

6.8.2

MPK Rewards Structure to incentivise usage

MPKs may be created and credited to users at the end of the month for actions promoting the
usage of the impak Coin. Examples of such transactions and rewards could be:
•

impak mobile app (wallet) installation:

25 MPK

•

first transaction with impak merchant:

10 MPK

•

a referred friend registering:

5 MPK

•

inviting personal network to impak.eco: 10 MPK

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

Other activities could also trigger MPK creation for an impak.eco user; i.e. commenting,
participating in a co-creation activity, mentorship, recommending, etc.
The MPK Governance Body may choose to cancel MPKs when buying them back, or to create
new MPKs through a crowd sale or otherwise as long as it results in supporting impak Coin’s
main purpose.

6.8.3

MPK-CAD Conversion Fee

In order to be financially sustainable and cover its operating costs, impak Finance will apply
transaction fees of 2% on MPK conversions to CAD.
For greater certainty, there are no transaction fees charged for transactions with Accredited
Merchants (as defined below).

6.8.4

MPK Governance Body

The impak Foundation will create, be a founding member of and oversee the MPK Governance
Body which will be the institution managing the MPK supply and market. The MPK Governance
Body will be composed of third party value aligned members that are active in the Impact
Economy. Those members will meet quarterly and determine the Monetary Policy and the action
to be taken in order to support the stability of the MPK.
Members of the MPK Governance Body will be appointed by the impak Foundation for a 1-year
mandate, renewable on merit based on their track record in the impact economy. Members can
be removed by decision from the impak Foundation.

6.8.5

Stability of the MPK Value

Although impak Coin will be supported by a fully decentralized blockchain (Waves), The MPK
Governance Body will control the value of the MPK through (a) the quarterly setting of the
exchange rate, and (b) market operations like buying or selling MPKs with its own CAD and MPK
reserve, adjusting transaction fees, adjusting the % in MPK cash-back and issuing new MPKs.
The goal is to ensure the impak Coin remains a growth catalyst for the impak.eco merchants that
accept MPK-based transactions. Its value will be initially pegged to the Canadian Dollar and will
be adjusted with the objective of maintaining purchasing power over a set basket of goods and
services.

6.9

Open and Trustworthy

We are convinced that the more impact businesses (Accredited Merchants) will have access to
impak.eco social network, the more they will make use of impak Coin, and the more the impak
Coin will be useful to them. Therefore, we want this ecosystem to be open, and we will welcome
all organizations that work to nurture the Impact Economy as part of impak.eco. Value aligned
credit unions and financial institutions, incubators, certification organizations, etc. will be invited to
join the MPK Governance Body and will be allowed to grant eWallets to the impact businesses
and organizations they work with. The impak ecosystem, together with impak Coin, will become
stronger as it attracts players in the impact sector, and as it relies less on impak Finance for its
growth.

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

Although only MPK Governance Body members will be able to qualify businesses as “impact
organizations” (Accredited Merchants) benefiting of such advantages as no transactions fees,
impak Finance will publish the API allowing anyone to create eWallet applications that trade in
MPKs.

6.10 Ongoing Information
On an ongoing basis, MPK holders will be able to access information related to the activity on the
impak.eco platform, such as statistics on the growth of impak.eco and the level of transactions,
as well as a listing of the new companies that have joined the ecosystem.
Furthermore, in order to provide an transparent picture of the financial health of the platform and
of the MPK, the MPK Governance Body will issue a quarterly Financial Bulletin containing the
following information :
>
>
>
>
>
>

Value of the MPK and Exchange Rate.
Description of the Basket of Goods & Services used as the benchmark for evaluating the
purchasing power of the MPK.
Number of MPKs outstanding.
Market operations conducted by the MPK Governance body (MPK issued or
repurchased)
Modifications to the Rewards Structure.
Balance of the MPK and CAD Reserve Funds.

MPK holders will be able to access impak Finance’s Audited Financial Statements, as well as the
quarterly Financial Bulletin and impak Finance’s unaudited interim financial statements, through
the SEDAR (System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval) platform under impak
Finance’s issuer profile as well as on the Corporation’s website.
From the time of the closing of the ICO and until the impak.eco platform and the impak Pay eWallet come on line, holders of impak Coin will be informed on a quarterly basis on the progress
made on the development of the platform, including the accomplishment of major milestones, and
in addition to getting regular news on the progress of impak Finance as a whole. Furthermore, the
impak Finance team will be available on a permanent “Slack" channel where holders of impak
Coin will not only be able to get answers to their questions in real time, but also make
suggestions in a collaborative way.

6.11 Low Cost and Energy Efficient
We choose Waves’ blockchain-as-a-service solution to support impak Coin.
“WAVES is a decentralized blockchain platform focusing on custom blockchain tokens
operations. National currencies transfer is maintained on the WAVES blockchain through
compliant gateway operators. Decentralized token exchange facilitates fundraising,
crowdfunding, and trading of financial instruments on the blockchain. Lightweight clients provide
7
an easy installation procedure and a flat learning curve for end users.“
Harnessing an already well-established blockchain like Waves will bring impak Coin robustness,
security and performances. Waves currently validates a transaction block under 15 seconds and

7

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

each transaction comes with a very small fee, which allows impak Coin to handle retail
transactions. Those fees absorb the cost of maintaining the blockchain infrastructure.
Waves also uses Proof-Of-Stake consensus algorithm which is many times more energy efficient
than the Proof-Of-Work used by other well-known blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum and that is
known to be a major carbon energy waste.
MPK infrastructure will consist of a layer between MPK eWallets (clients) and Waves blockchain.
This layer will provide the API allowing clients to make transactions and encode those to Waves.
It will also implement all transactions rules aimed to support the impak Coin.

6.12 Compliant
Managing our own layer of software to validate transactions will allow us to implement
compliancy rules that every financial institution has to follow: anti money laundering, taxes
declarations. A KYC process will be mandatory to open an MPK eWallet, and even if transactions
will appear as anonymous on the Waves blockchain, users’ identity will be known by the MPK
Governance Body, which will have the responsibility to disclose unusual transactions to
authorities as well as to provide all information required by tax authorities. During the initial
deployment phase, only impak Finance will be allowed to create MPK eWallets (with respect to
the KYC process). Further in time, value aligned third parties may be entitled by the MPK
Governance Body to create MPK eWallets and maintain such processes.

6.13 The time is now
We see an increasing number of companies across a variety of industries making the first
tentative steps in blockchain adoption. They are realising that there is a pressing need to get
ahead of the curve and beat the competition. Primary interest in the sector is coming from tech
giants (Microsoft, IBM, Amazon) and major Wall Street banks (JPMorgan, Citigroup), with
companies such as Infosys, TCS and HCL reportedly working on blockchain-based products to
support the financial industry. R3 was the first blockchain company in the financial sector;
founded in 2014 it now leads a consortium of more than 70 of the world’s biggest financial
institutions and working on a variety of projects that it is rapidly patenting.
Meanwhile, the demand for blockchain technology in finance and financial services is growing on
a worldwide scale, primarily in the developing world. A multitude of economies within Latin
America, Southeast Asia and Africa have strict currency control laws and are seeing consumers
flock towards alternatives to mainstream financial institutions. People who have no bank account,
simply to use alternative financial services, are activating over 1 million smartphones a month.
In terms of entrepreneurial ventures, we have also seen a clear trend emerge in the last few
years. Broadly speaking, 2015 was the year when financial institutions and fintech startups
discovered blockchain technology. 2016 was then the year of pilots and first deployments.
Following on this trend, we project that 2017 will be the year when blockchain enterprise solutions
leave the pilot phase and proceed to commercialization and wide-scale adoption.
As we can observe, the large majority of blockchain initiatives are developed within the same
economic mind frame of profit maximisation. We believe that the intrinsic characteristics and
innovations of cryptocurrencies can be leveraged in order to have a positive social impact on our
world. This is at the center of the impak Project.

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are changing the world. They can also have a
positive social impact. You can either stand beside and observe – or you can
become part of history in the making.
For us, 2017 is the year to use blockchain technology to invite every Citizen in supporting
impactful enterprises of the real economy wanting to make your world a better place. We believe
that the technology is finally ready to be utilized in the real world by a large population.
Through the impak Coin launch we are paving the way for other organizations to follow suit. We
are creating a state-of-the-art model to attract citizens wanting to transform our economies
towards a more decentralized model, following the worldwide trend. The technology we are using
highlights scalability and security. We have also laid out a governance roadmap which solves
many of the grey areas previous blockchain-based investments have found challenging.
We know that the internet was somewhat of a niche novelty until the browsers, email clients,
search engines and online retailers came along. Then, suddenly, it became a household
necessity. With blockchain, it has taken years to build up the basic infrastructure rooted in
cryptocurrency. 2017 will be the year when this all finally takes off.

6.14 Subscription Procedure
Participants in this ICO will be able to purchase impak Coins (MPK) through impakcoin.com.
Participants will undergo an adapted KYC and Suitability process that reflects impak Finance’s
will to integrate in its impak Coin ICO the best practices in the field of capital raising. Special care
has been taken to align the subscription process to that of Exempt Market Products, while
Purchasers of MPKs will be able to do so by paying either by credit card or by using Bitcoin or
Ethereum.

7.1.5

Changes in Legislation

There can be no assurance that income tax laws and laws relating to the banking industry will not
be changed in a manner which adversely affects the Corporation or distributions received by its
security holders.

7.1.6

Speculative participation

A participation in the Crowdsale is highly speculative. Purchasing the MPK currency in advance
should be considered only by participants who are able to make a long term commitment and are
aware of the risk factors involved in such an participation. You should only purchase the MPK
currency if you are able to bear the risk of the entire loss of your participation and have no need
for immediate liquidity in such purchase.

7.1.7

MPK Holders may experience more dilution.

The Corporation is authorized to issue the MPK cryptocurrency according to the terms described
in this White Paper. MPK holders may experience more dilution in the future.

7.1.8

No guaranties of liquidity for the MPK.

There is absolutely no guarantee that impak Coin holders will be able to sell Coins through the
MPK marketplace as there is a high risk of having no buyers or sellers if the impak Project is not
a commercial success. Consequently, it may be difficult or even impossible for Users to sell
impak Coins.

7.1.9

Restrictions on resale of MPK.

There are restrictions on resale of the impak Coin for participants of this Crowd sale. Such
restrictions on resale are described in Section 10 of this White Paper.

7.1.10 MPKs are not insured.
The Corporation is not a member institution of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation and
MPKs pre-sold in this crowdsale are not insured against loss.

7.1.11 Less than Full Amount pre-sold
There can be no assurance that more than the minimum amount will be pre-sold. In that case,
less than the maximum funds will be available to the Corporation and, consequently, its
technology development and business development plans and prospects could be adversely
affected.

7.1.12 Absence of validation of the information provided to the Corporation and
reproduced in this Offering Memorandum
The information provided to the Corporation by any person and reproduced in this Offering
Memorandum about such persons or about activities of any other person than the Corporation
has not been at this stage verified by the Corporation and as such, might not be accurate in
whole or in part and no one shall rely on any of such information for the purposes of participating
in the Offering.

7.1.13 Main Principles of MPK CrowdSale
By transferring Ether (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC) to the MPK Crowd sale platform and the MPK
Software System creating and assigning impak Coins to User, User confirms to understand and
accept that User makes a contribution into the MPK Crowd sale platform for the development of
software, in particular the impak Coin, eWallet, and impak.eco social network, and the respective
IP rights, including security audits, marketing & communication and research activities related to
the development of impak.eco and impak Coin (together “IMPAK PROJECT”).

7.1.14 Development on a best effort basis
User and Participant in the MPK Crowd sale further confirms to understand and accept that while
the individuals and entities assigned to this task, in particular the Corporation and its
subcontractors, will make reasonable efforts to develop and complete the impak Project, it is
possible that such development may partially or fully fail and User’s impak Coins become
useless-and/or valueless due to technical, commercial, regulatory or any other reasons (see
Section 6.1. regarding risks).

7.1.15 Complete loss due to Commercial Risk
User is also aware of the risk that even if all or parts of the impak Coin are successfully
developed and released in full or in parts, due to a lack of public interest, the impak Project could
be fully or partially abandoned, remain commercially unsuccessful or be shut down for lack of
interest or other reasons. User therefore confirms to understand and accept that the transfer of
Ether (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC) or fiat money to the MPK Crowdsale platform and the creation of
impak Coins carry significant financial and/or regulatory risks (including the complete loss of the
contributed Ether (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC) or fiat money or the loss of any value or functionality of
allocated impak Coins .

7.1.16 Complete understanding of terms and conditions
By transferring Ether (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC) or fiat money to the MPK Crowdsale platform User

7.1.17 Usage License. No Ownership, Revenue or Governance Rights.
Ownership of impak Coin (MPK) carries no rights express or implied other than a limited right
(license) to use the MPK Software System and digital means of exchange in the MPK Blockchain
network, if and to the extent the MPK Software System has been successfully completed and
deployed. In particular, User understands and accepts that impak Coin do not represent or
constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security or equivalent rights nor any right to
receive future revenues shares or any other form of participation or governance right in or relating
to the impak Project (i.e. the MPK Software System) and/or the Corporation.

7.2
7.2.1

Business Risk
No assurance of profitability

The Corporation operates at a loss and there is no assurance that the Corporation will ever be
profitable. No revenues have been recorded as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, as the
revenue model is contingent on the interactions generated on the impak.eco platform.

7.2.2

Financial Hardship

Most of the proceeds from an equity crowdfunding campaign the Corporation has conducted in
Q4 2016 have been utilized to start coding the impak.eco platform (including the MPK) and to
assemble the team required to achieve the Corporation’s business objectives. As of the date of
this offering memorandum, the Corporation would not have the financial resources to complete
the development of the impak.eco platform and the MPK without the proceeds of this ICO.

7.2.3

There is no guarantee that the Corporation will obtain status as a
Schedule I Bank under the Bank Act.

After the completion of the Crowdsale and subject to receiving sufficient funds, the Corporation
intends to apply to obtain status as a Schedule I Bank as defined under the Bank Act. There is no
guarantee as to when the Corporation will obtain status as a Schedule I Bank, or if it will ever
obtain such status. If the Corporation’s application is rejected, the Corporation will modify its
business plan and it could adversely affect the Corporation’s business and financial condition.

7.2.4

Personal data

The Corporation receives, transmits and stores a large volume of personally identifiable
information and other sensitive data from its customers and potential customers, including each
participant’s public and private key. There are federal, provincial and foreign laws regarding
privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable
information and sensitive data. Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly
subject to legislation and regulations to protect the privacy of personal information that is
collected, processed and transmitted. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require
the Corporation to change its business practices or operational structure, address legal claims
and sustain monetary penalties and/or other harms to its business.

© impak Finance inc. 2017

47

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

The regulatory framework for privacy issues in Canada is constantly evolving and is likely to
remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The interpretation and application of such laws is
often uncertain, and such laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with the
Corporation’s current policies and practices or require changes to the features of its platform. If
either the Corporation or its third-party service providers are unable to address any privacy
concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could result in
additional costs and liability, damage its reputation and harm its business.

7.2.5

Additional capital may be required

The Corporation intends to continue to make investments to support the growth of its business.
As such, it may require additional capital to pursue its business objectives and respond to
business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including increasing its
marketing expenditures to improve its brand awareness, developing new products or services or
further improving existing products or services, enhancing its operating infrastructure and
acquiring complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, it may need to engage in
equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be
available when the Corporation needs them, on terms that are acceptable to the Corporation, or
at all. In addition, the Corporation’s agreements with other lenders may make it more difficult for it
to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.
If the Corporation raises additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt
securities, its existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities
the Corporation issues could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders
of its common stock. If the Corporation is unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on
terms satisfactory to the Corporation, when it requires, its ability to continue to pursue its
business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen
circumstances could be significantly limited, and its business, operating results, financial
conditions and prospects could be adversely affected.

7.2.6

Risks Inherent to the WAVES Platform

Waves is a public blockchain and therefore its content is accessible to any of its participating
peers. Anyone can join Waves by creating a node and have access to all its content. The
Corporation will only store encrypted content on the Waves platform, but cannot guarantee that
the Waves platform will not be hacked and data compromised.

7.2.7

Security breaches of customers’ confidential information

The Corporation stores customers’ personal and banking information and other sensitive data,
including each participant’s public and private key. Any accidental or wilful security breaches or
other unauthorized access could cause the theft and criminal use of this data. Security breaches
or unauthorized access to confidential information could also expose the Corporation to liability
related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative
publicity. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error,
malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in the Corporation’s software are exposed and
exploited, and, as a result, a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of its customers’
data, the Corporation’s relationships with its customers will be severely damaged, and the
Corporation could incur significant liability.

© impak Finance inc. 2017

48

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change
frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the
Corporation and third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to
implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, certain provinces have enacted laws
requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data.
These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead
to widespread negative publicity, which may cause the Corporation’s customers to lose
confidence in the effectiveness of its data security measures. Any security breach, whether actual
or perceived, would harm its reputation and the Corporation may lose customers.

7.2.8

If products and platform enhancements do not achieve sufficient market
acceptance

The Corporation incurs expenses and expends resources upfront to develop, acquire and market
new products and platform enhancements to incorporate additional features, improve functionality
or otherwise make its platform more desirable to its customers.

7.2.9

It may be difficult and costly to protect the intellectual property rights, and
the Corporation may not be able to ensure their protection.

The Corporation’s ability to service its customers depends, in part, upon its intellectual property. It
primarily relies on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and
confidentiality or license agreements with its employees, customers and others to protect its
intellectual property rights. However, the steps it takes to protect its intellectual property rights
may be inadequate. The Corporation currently does not have any issued patents.
In order to protect its intellectual property rights, the Corporation may be required to spend
significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce
its intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and
could result in the impairment or loss of portions of its intellectual property. Furthermore, its
efforts to enforce its intellectual property rights may be met with defences, counterclaims and
countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of its intellectual property rights. The
Corporation’s failure to secure, protect and enforce its intellectual property rights could seriously
harm its brand and adversely affect its business.

7.2.10 The Corporation’s success and future growth depend in part on its
successful marketing efforts and increased brand awareness.
The Corporation believes that an important component of its growth will be continued market
penetration through its direct marketing channel. To achieve this growth, the Corporation
anticipates relying heavily on marketing and advertising to increase the visibility of the impak
brand with potential customers. The goal of this marketing and advertising is to increase the
strength, recognition and trust in the impak brand, drive more unique visitors to submit
applications on its mobile platform, and ultimately increase the number of customers banking with
the Corporation or the number of loans made to its customers.
If the Corporation is unable to recover its marketing costs through an increase in the number of
saving accounts opened and in the number of loans made, or if it discontinues its broad
marketing campaigns, it could have a material adverse effect on its growth, results of operations
and financial condition.

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

7.2.11 The Corporation relies on its management team and need additional key
personnel to grow its business, and the loss of key employees or inability
to hire key personnel could harm its business.
The Corporation believes its success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and
talents of its executives and employees, including Paul Allard, Tima Gros, Philippe Gablain,
Pierre-Étienne Vachon, François Le Bel, Stéphane Dumont, Armen Ouzounian and Jean Oulhen.
Its future success depends on its continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly
qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and the Corporation
may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of its senior
management or key employees could materially adversely affect its ability to execute its business
plan and strategy, and it may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at
all.

7.2.12 Litigation may adversely affect the Corporation’s business and financial
condition.
The Corporation’s business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, customers,
consumers, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies, or others through private
actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The
outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and intellectual property
claims, is difficult to assess or quantity. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of
very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these
lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these
lawsuits, if decided adversely to the Corporation or settled by the Corporation, may result in
liability material to its financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect its operating
results if changes to its business operations are required. The cost to defend future litigation may
be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively
affect customer perception of its business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or
whether the Corporation are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect its
business and financial condition.

7.3

Industry Risk

7.3.1

Limited operating history in an evolving industry

The Corporation has no operating history in an evolving industry that may not develop as
expected. Assessing its business and future prospects is challenging in light of the risks and
difficulties it may encounter. These risks and difficulties include its ability to:
•

navigate complex and evolving regulatory and competitive environments;

•

increase the number of customers;

•

successfully maintain and evolve our internal controls to manage compliance with an
evolving and complex regulatory environment;

•

improve the terms on which the Corporation lends to its customers as its business
becomes more efficient;

•

increase the effectiveness of its direct marketing and ability to identify the trends
relevant to its targeted demographics;

•

successfully develop and deploy new products;

•

successfully maintain its funding strategy;

•

favorably compete with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter,
the business of financial services to its targeted demographics;

•

successfully navigate economic conditions and fluctuations in the financial services
market;

•

effectively manage the growth of its business;

•

successfully expand its business;

•

continue to revise its platform’s proprietary credit model;

•

continue to develop, maintain and scale its platform;

•

effectively use limited personnel and technology resources;

•

effectively maintain and scale its financial and risk management controls and
procedures;

•

maintain the security of its platform and the confidentiality of the information provided
and utilized across its platform; and

•

attract, integrate and retain an appropriate number of qualified employees.

7.3.2

The financial services industry is highly regulated

The Corporation’s business is subject to numerous federal, provincial and other local laws,
ordinances and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates, which are subject to
change and which may impose significant costs or limitations on the way the Corporation
conducts or expands its business. These regulations govern, or affect, among other things:
•

lending and collection practices, such as truth in lending and short-term and instalment
lending and continuous payment authority;

•

interest rates and usury;

•

loan amount and fee limitations;

•

licensing and posting of fees; and

•

privacy of personal consumer information.

As the Corporation develops and introduces new products and services, it may become subject
to additional laws and regulations. Future legislation or regulations may restrict the Corporation’s
ability to continue its current methods of operation or expand its operations and may have a
negative effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, future
legislation or regulations, or amendments to existing regulatory regime, could require the
Corporation to modify its platform and processes, which may cause the Corporation to incur
additional costs.

8.1

Income Tax Consequences and RRSP Eligibility

You should consult your own professional advisors to obtain advice on the income tax
consequences that apply to you.

8.2

Changes in Legislation

impak Coin usage is subject to changes in Canadian federal and provincial tax laws, tax
proposals, other governmental policies or regulations and governmental, administrative or judicial
interpretation of the same. There can be no assurance that tax laws, tax proposals, policies or
regulations, or the interpretation thereof, will not be changed in a manner which will
fundamentally alter the tax consequences to impak Coin holders acquiring, holding or disposing
of MPKs.
For all of the aforesaid reasons and others set forth and not set forth herein, impak Coin involves
a certain degree of risk. Any person considering the purchase of MPKs should be aware of these
and other factors set forth in this White Paper and should consult with his/her legal, tax and
financial advisors prior to making an investment in MPKs. MPKs should only be purchased by
persons who can afford to lose all of their total investment.

9. Reporting Obligations
9.1

Documents Provided to Shareholders Annually

The Corporation is not required to send you any documents on an annual or ongoing
basis. The Corporation is not a “reporting issuer” as such term is defined in applicable securities
legislation and accordingly is not subject to most of the continuous disclosure reporting
obligations imposed on reporting issuers by securities legislation in Quebec. In accordance with
requirements of the Canada Business Corporations Act, the Corporation is required to place
audited financial statements before its shareholders at each annual general meeting and to
deposit copies for inspection in its corporate records maintained at its records office which are
available for inspection by any shareholders during normal business hours.

9.2

Sources of Information about the Corporation

11. Purchasers’ Rights
If you purchase these securities, you will have certain rights, some of which are described below.
For information about your rights, you should consult a lawyer.
The following is a summary of the statutory or contractual rights of action for damages or
rescission which may be available to a purchaser of impak Coins. The applicable securities laws
in certain jurisdictions provides purchasers, or requires purchasers be provided, with remedies for
rescission or damages, or both, if this Offering Memorandum or any amendment to it or any

In addition, a person or company, other than the issuer, will not be liable if that person or

general notice of the withdrawal and the reason for it; or
(c) with respect to any part of the offering memorandum or amendment to the offering
memorandum purporting (i) to be made on the authority of an expert, or (ii) to be a copy

of the offering memorandum or amendment to the offering memorandum not purporting (a) to be

Offering Memorandum - 15 AUG 2017

investigation to provide reasonable grounds for a belief that there had been no Misrepresentation
or (ii) believed that there had been a Misrepresentation.

11.9 New Brunswick
Section 150 of the Securities Act (New Brunswick) provides that where an offering memorandum
(such as this Offering Memorandum) contains a Misrepresentation, a purchaser who purchases
securities shall be deemed to have relied on the Misrepresentation if it was a Misrepresentation
at the time of purchase and:
(a) the purchaser has a right of action for damages against the issuer and any selling
security holder(s) on whose behalf the distribution is made, or
(b) where the purchaser purchased the securities from a person referred to in paragraph (a),
the purchaser may elect to exercise a right of rescission against the person, in which
case the purchaser shall have no right of action for damages against the person.
(c) This statutory right of action is available to New Brunswick purchasers whether or not
such purchaser relied on the Misrepresentation. However, there are various defences
available to the issuer and the selling security holder(s). In particular, no person will be
liable for a Misrepresentation if such person proves that the purchaser purchased the
securities with knowledge of the Misrepresentation when the purchaser purchased the
securities. Moreover, in an action for damages, the amount recoverable will not exceed
the price at which the securities were offered under the offering memorandum and any
defendant will not be liable for all or any part of the damages that the defendant proves
do not represent the depreciation in value of the security as a result of the
misrepresentation.
If the purchaser intends to rely on the rights described in (a) or (b) above, such purchaser must
do so within strict time limitations. The purchaser must commence an action to cancel the
agreement within 180 days after the date of the transaction that gave rise to the cause of action.
The purchaser must commence its action for damages within the earlier of:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of
Impak Finance Inc. which comprise the consolidated statement of financial
position as at April 30, 2017 and the consolidated statement of comprehensive
loss, changes in equity and cash flows for the initial year then ended, and a
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Management's responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and for such internal control as management
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audit. We concluded on our audit in accordance with
Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation

7CJ@CN!LD!3N?KP!<FLNKPLK!5KPCNK?PGLK?I!6PB!

3

of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audit is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Impak Finance Inc. as at April 30, 2017 and
its financial performance and its cash flows for the initial year then ended, in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

1. INCORPORATION AND BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
Impak Finance Inc. (“Impak Finance” or “Company”) was incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations
Act on May 5, 2016. Impak Finance is an independent financial institution founded by entrepreneurs and banking
professionals wanting to positively contribute and address some of the greatest social and environmental issues
of our time. The Company’s mission is to make money work for positive social, innovative and environmental
impact through an online collaborative financial ecosystem powered by disruptive financial technologies developed
by the Company and third-party vendors. Impak Finance connects savers and investors who want to change the
world for the better with entrepreneurs and sustainable companies having the same objectives. The head and
principal office of the Company is located at 2700 – 1000 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, Quebec, Canada
H3A 3G4. The Company incorporated its subsidiary Impak Capital Finance Inc. on March 31, 2017. The
Company’s financial year-end is April 30 .
th

Going concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared using International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities
in the normal course of operations as they come due. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is
appropriate, management takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but not
limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting period.
At April 30, 2017, management of the Company believes that it has sufficient working capital to meet its current
liabilities, and that the Company will have sufficient cash flow through its operation or issuance of equity to pay
for its ongoing expenses for at least the next 12 months. The Company will need to raise funds in the future through
the issuance of equity instruments or other arrangement to meet future work requirements. While management has
been successful in securing financing in the past, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future
or that sources of funding or initiatives will be available to the Company or that they will be available when such
funds are required.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies described below were consistently applied in these consolidated financial statements,
unless otherwise indicated.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
a) Statement of compliance
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The consolidated financial statements were approved and authorized for issue by
the Board of Directors on July 20, 2017.
b) Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
c) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiary: Impak Capital Finance Inc. The subsidiary has not begun its activities.
The Parent company has control of a subsidiary when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary.
The subsidiary has a reporting date of April 30th. All intercompany balances, revenues and expenses are
eliminated upon consolidation including unrealized gains and losses on transactions between the Impak
Finance’s companies. The account balances of the subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company from the acquisition’s date until the date on which the Company ceases to control
them.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION (cont’d)
d) Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars. The functional currency of Impak
Finance and its subsidiary is the Canadian dollars.
BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE
The Company presents basic and diluted loss per share for its common shares, calculated by dividing the net loss
attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period.
The diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution of common share equivalents, such as outstanding stock
options in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, if dilutive.
For the year ended April 30, 2017 the potentially diluted loss per share was the same as the basic loss per share
since there was no outstanding activities.
INCOME TAXES
The Company applies the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Current tax expense is recognized
based on the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using the enacted tax rate at period end,
adjusted for any amendments with regards to previous years.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses
carried forward. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the substantively enacted tax rates
that will be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the underlying tax loss or deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax
liabilities are always recognized in full. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the Company has
a right and intention to set off current tax assets and liabilities from the same taxation authority.
Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized as a component of tax income or expense in profit
or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,
in which case the related deferred tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or equity, respectively.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one party and a financial liability or
equity instrument of another party.
Financial assets are classified into the following categories at their initial recognition:
•
•
•
•

financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”);
held-to-maturity investments;
loans and receivables;
or available-for-sale investments.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Cont’d)
Financial liabilities are classified into the following categories at their initial recognition:
•
•

financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss;
or financial liabilities measured at amortized cost

Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, plus, in the case of a financial asset or liability not
at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of the financial
asset or liability.
Financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value, except for financial assets classified as held-to- maturity
investments or loans and receivables, which are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest
method. Any interest revenue resulting from the amortization is recorded in profit and loss.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at fair value. All other financial
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Any interest expense resulting
from the amortization is recorded in profit and loss within general and administrative expenses.
All financial assets except for those measured at fair value through profit or loss are subject to review for impairment at
least at each reporting date. Financial assets are impaired when there is any objective evidence that a financial asset is
impaired.
Individually significant receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other objective
evidence is received that a specific counterparty will default. Receivables that are not considered to be individually
impaired are reviewed for impairment in groups, which are determined by reference to the industry sector. Objective
evidence that a financial asset is impaired could include the Company’s historical collection experience, an increase in
the portfolio recovery period and any domestic or local change in economic conditions in correlation with debtors’
failure to pay.
Classification
Cash
Trade and other payables

Loans and receivables
Financial liabilities at amortized cost

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation
is calculated on their respective estimated useful life using the straight-line method and periods:

Furniture and fixtures

Per iods
5 years

Computer equipment

3 years

Gains and losses from sale of property and equipment are calculated as the difference between sale price and carrying
value at date of sale and are included in general and administrative expenses.
Depreciation methods, residual value estimates and estimated useful lives are reviewed at least annually. Assets are
depreciated once they are available for use.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
OPERATING LEASES
All leases are treated as operating leases. Where the Company is a lessee, payments on operating lease agreements are
recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Associated costs, such as maintenance and
insurance, are expensed as incurred.
EQUITY
Share capital represents the amount received on the issue of shares, less issuance costs, net of any underlying income
tax benefit from these issuance costs.
Deficit includes all current and prior year retained profit or loss.
3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED AND ADOPTED STANDARDS
At the date of authorization of these consolidated financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and
interpretations to existing standards have been published but are not yet effective, and have not been early adopted by
the Company.
Management anticipates that all of the pronouncements will be adopted in the Company's accounting policies for the
first period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and
interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Company's financial statements is provided below. Certain other
new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments
In July 2014, the final version of the IFRS 9 standard was published to replace IAS 39: Financial instrument: recognition
and measurement. It simplifies the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities by reducing
the number of measurement categories. The new standard also includes new requirements with regards to general hedge
accounting and impairment of financial assets. The effective date of this new standard will be for periods beginning on
or after January 1st, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company has yet to assess the impact of this standard on
its consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 15, Revenues from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014, the IASB published IFRS 15 which replaces IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and some
revenue-related interpretations. IFRS 15 establishes a new control-based revenue recognition model, changes the basis
for deciding when revenue is recognized at a point in time or over time, provides new and more detailed guidance on
specific topics and expands and improves disclosures about revenue. IFRS 15 is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after January 1st, 2018. Earlier application is permitted. The Company has yet to assess the impact of
this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 16, Leases
In January 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 which will replace IAS 17 Leases. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification
as an operating lease and requires lessees to recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease liability in the statement of financial
position. An exemption is permitted for short-term leases and for leases of low-value assets. Additionally, IFRS 16
changes the definition of a lease, sets requirements on how to account for the asset and liability, including complexities
such as non-lease elements, variable lease payments and option periods changes the accounting for sale and leaseback
arrangements largely retains IAS 17’s approach to lessor accounting and introduces new disclosure requirements. IFRS
16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1st, 2019, with early application permitted in certain
circumstances. The Company has yet to assess the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.

4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The application of the Company’s accounting policies, in accordance with IFRS, requires management to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on the revenues, expenses, comprehensive loss,
assets and liabilities recognized and disclosures made in the financial statements. Although these estimates are based on
management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Significant assumptions which are at risk of causing a material adjustment to the amounts recognized in the consolidated
financial statements are:
DEFERRED TAX ASSETS
The assessment of availability of future taxable profits involves judgment. A deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences and the carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.
USEFUL LIVES OF DEPRECIABLE ASSETS
Management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date, based on the expected
utility of the assets. The carrying amounts are presented in Note 5. Actual results however may vary due to technical
obsolescence.

The ability to realize the tax benefits is dependent upon a number of factors, including the future profitability of
operations. Deferred tax assets are recognized in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to
deferred tax assets only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow the asset
to be recovered. Accordingly, deferred tax assets have not been recognized.
The Company has $995,838 non-capital losses which are available to reduce income taxes in future periods, that can be
carried over 2037.

10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk of the Company not being able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company
manages liquidity risk through the management of its working capital ratio. It also manages liquidity risk by continuously
monitoring actual and projected cash flows. The Board of Directors reviews and approves the Company's operating and
capital budgets.
As at April 30, 2017, the Company was holding cash of $321,254. In order to maintain or adjust its capital structure, the
Company may be required to issue new shares or raise debt.

11. CAPITAL DISCLOSURES
The Company’s objective when managing its capital is to ensure sufficient equity financing to fund its mission to build
an enterprise that will make money work for positive social and environmental impact through an online collaborative
financial ecosystem. The capital which the Company raises will be used to fund its operations, technology infrastructure,
staffing and product design. The Company considers shareholders’ equity as capital. Through the ongoing management
of its capital, the Company will modify the structure of its capital based on changing economic conditions, in doing so,
the Company may issue new shares. Annual budgeting is the primary tool used to manage the Company’s capital.
Updates are made as necessary to both capital expenditure and operational budgets in order to adapt to changes in risk
factors proposed expenditure programs and market conditions.
