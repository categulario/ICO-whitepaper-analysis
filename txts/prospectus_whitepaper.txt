Introduction
Digitaliza�on of our daily lives is now an undisputed phenomenon, which is here to stay.
According to studies made in 2015 and 2016, over 80% of developed countries’ popula�on have
some access to the Internet. Furthermore, over 60% of European ci�zens own a smartphone. It
implies them being near constantly online.
With the world ge�ng more connected, an increasing number of companies strive to oﬀer their
services and solu�ons online. Finance, educa�on, healthcare, commerce and leisure providers are
ac�vely moving towards digi�za�on in an a�empt to serve the exis�ng and ﬁnd new customers
worldwide.
European Parliament, along with other regulatory authori�es across the globe are now ac�vely
outlining new rules and principles for e-services. The legal framework removes regulatory
uncertainty serving as a catalyst for the business migra�on online. We’ve undertaken a thorough
analysis of the latest trends including rules around eID, QES and Trustee services as well as the
Aggrega�on of Payment Services within the scope of the PSD2. And this is where Polybius steps
in.
Polybius Foundation, a team of ﬁnancial, security, legal and technical experts is raising funds for
its project Polybius Bank. Our goal is to capitalize on the broader digitaliza�on trend with a
par�cular focus on:
1. Financial services which is at the core of all business interac�ons;
2. Digital ID and wallet concepts needed to serve as gateway to the eCommerce market.
With the success of the ICO, Polybius Bank will become a fully digital bank accessible everywhere
at any �me. It will have all the func�ons of a classical bank, but will not host any branches nor
physical front-oﬃces and will rely fully on the latest digital technologies.
This will enable Polybius Bank to be among the least expensive banks to operate in the world, with
a very eﬃcient cost/revenue ra�o and gran�ng its backers with higher returns.
The Polybius Bank project is aimed to establish an online scalable ﬁnancial infrastructure for
businesses and individuals, provide electronic iden�ty and trustee services across the EU, and
create a user authen�ca�on and payment processing gateway for not only online merchants, but
also commercial, corporate and governmental services.
This prospectus covers business, technical and regulatory details of the project, our step-by-step
milestone plan and the technologies which will be developed as the basis of Polybius
infrastructure.

The tokens have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securi�es Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securi�es
Act”), and may not be oﬀered or sold in the United States or to or for the beneﬁt of US persons (as deﬁned in Regula�on S under
the Securi�es Act) unless they are so registered, or an exemp�on from the registra�on requirements of the Securi�es Act is
available. One such exemp�on allows the resale of tokens purchased for their own account and for investment purposes only by
investors who (i) are not otherwise aﬃliated with the Polybius Founda�on, (ii) have been exposed for some �me to the economic
risks that ownership of tokens entails, and (iii) are not part of the distribu�on of the tokens.

What is Polybius?
While star�ng oﬀ as primarily a ﬁnancial ins�tu�on, the Polybius project is meant to grow into
your daily servicer and companion ecosystem. It will aim to enable secure and seamless
connec�ons between life and the things we love and use every day.
The key elements of Polybius ecosystem are the Polybius Foundation and the Digital Pass.
Polybius Founda�on is the subject fostering the Polybius Bank or Polybius Payment Ins�tu�on
(P.I.) at the start. Its customers will not only get access to a variety of ﬁnancial services, but will
likely be among the ﬁrst to get the PolyID that will plug them into the Digital Pass environment.
Digital Pass is an independent environment as a service, which will serve as a storage for
encrypted individual informa�on. The security of access to the informa�on will be enabled by SSL
cer�ﬁcates, dynamic PINs and, to some extent, by biometrical data. The security will be compliant
with the PSD2 RTS requirements issued by the EBA Authority on 23.02.2017.
Among other planned features are scoring and sensi�vity systems for credit and insurance
businesses, asset and currency trading systems, seed & VC investment tools, eID and Trust
services and other features described in this Prospectus.
Polybius is being designed as a highly scalable pla�orm targeted at simplifying our daily lives.

ICO structure
The Polybius Foundation is raising funds to support the establishment of the Polybius Bank or the
Polybius Payment Institution and to deliver the respec�ve technologies. For that reason, Polybius
Foundation is issuing Polybius Tokens (PLBT) through the smart contract system operated by
Ethereum (ref to Annex 1). The funds raised by the sale of tokens will be retained by the Polybius
Foundation un�l they will be used.
Polybius Foundation is a public registered body with legal responsibili�es and is subject to audits.
This will ensure the transparency of opera�ons and the secure custody of the funds.

Polybius Token symbol

Token name: PLBT Token - Polybius Proﬁt-Share Smart Contract
A Polybius Token represents the right to receive a part of distributable proﬁts of Polybius P.I. or
Polybius Bank. All tokens in aggregate will have the right to receive 20% of such proﬁts.
The Tokens will be assigned pro-rata to the funds provided to the Polybius Foundation during the
ICO.
Payout Structure:
According to the Bylaws, at the end of a ﬁnancial year, 20%1 of distributable proﬁt of Polybius
Payment Institution or Polybius Bank is transferred to the speciﬁc Ethereum (ETH) wallet. The ETH
is then redistributed to all holders of Polybius tokens according to smart contract condi�ons (i.e.
the stake of proﬁt is received pro-rata the share of tokens owned).
Token supply:
The total supply is not locked, as we will need to be able to add tokens before the end of sale and
revoke the unsold amount.
Ini�al Rate:
Price per token is locked on 10 USD per 1 Token.

Milestone Plan
Polybius Milestone Plan
The road to crea�ng a bank involves many diﬀerent aspects, such as licenses, compliances,
technologies, consor�a and crea�vity.
Below you can see the milestone roadmap that covers the most signiﬁcant levels of ﬁnancial
ac�vity that we will be achieving with our ICO. Every step milestone is meant to be incremental to
the preceding one and to be implemented according to the market response to the proposals.
ICO proceeds are intended to be spent mainly, but not exclusively on acquisi�on of licenses,
building out the systems, hiring the team and marke�ng.

At Polybius Bank or P.I., we will rely on a set of public and private licenses instrumental to comply
with many regula�ons, exis�ng in the ﬁnancial ﬁeld. Among them are the public EMI and banking
licenses, the par�cipa�on in Card Schemes, the crea�on of regula�on-compliant iden�ﬁca�on
mechanisms and other technical condi�ons to meet.
Every milestone step is an advancement to a broader set of services at Polybius customers'
disposal. While our in-house Digital Pass service and technology will serve as a pla�orm at the
core of the Polybius Bank or P.I., other features may be developed independently. During this
process, the ecosystem will be formed and Digital Pass will start its primary day-to-day
opera�ons.
As for the customer base, Polybius strategic partners will provide an ini�al base of users for the
Polybius Bank or P.I. disposal. We expect access to ca. 500’000 users at incep�on. This will give us
a strong base for growth and a quicker path to building revenues and to proﬁtability.
The tokens have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securi�es Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securi�es
Act”), and may not be oﬀered or sold in the United States or to or for the beneﬁt of US persons (as deﬁned in Regula�on S under

investors who (i) are not otherwise aﬃliated with the Polybius Founda�on, (ii) have been exposed for some �me to the economic
risks that ownership of tokens entails, and (iii) are not part of the distribu�on of the tokens.

API
Authorized Payment Ins�tu�on

During the ini�al step for a viable Polybius opera�on, a set of condi�ons needs to be met. Among
the minimal requirements are licenses (small Electronic Money Ins�tu�on (sEMI) or Payment
Ins�tu�on (P.I.) licenses) and mechanisms to comply with the law and ﬁnancial regula�ons (such
as Know Your Customer (KYC), An� Money Laundering (AML), Comba�ng Financing of Terrorism
(CFT), etc).
At this step, instead of the sEMI license, we, at Polybius, aim to apply for a license for the Polybius
Authorized Payment Ins�tu�on (A.P.I.) for the sake of lowering the ini�al investment
requirement. A.P.I. license is required to store clients’ money and organize payment processes.
The �me required to acquire the license is 3-9 months.
At this milestone, Polybius Payment Institution, or Polybius A.P.I., will be legally considered a
non-banking ﬁnancial ins�tu�on (NBFI-ND) and will not take deposits un�l acquisi�on of the
banking license.
SWIFT membership is also required as one of the key elements for banking procedures. Joining
the SWIFT network enables a bank to receive a Business Iden�ﬁer Code (BIC), and to be able to
communicate with other ﬁnancial organiza�ons via SWIFT messages for electronic money
transac�ons. It may take up to 3 months for the applica�on to pass through.
Polybius Payment Institution will adhere to the EPC Rulebooks to use them in the European
payment and messaging network for the Euro zone. The EPC Rulebooks deﬁne principles of
money transfer in Euro according to the European Union Regulatory Framework. The �me
required to join and to operate the EPC Rulebook network is expected to be 6 months.

The tokens have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securi�es Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securi�es
Act”), and may not be oﬀered or sold in the United States or to or for the beneﬁt of US persons (as deﬁned in Regula�on S under
the Securi�es Act) unless they are so registered, or an exemp�on from the registra�on requirements of the Securi�es Act is
available. One such exemp�on allows the resale of tokens purchased for their own account and for investment purposes only by
investors who (i) are not otherwise aﬃliated with the Polybius Founda�on, (ii) have been exposed for some �me to the economic
risks that ownership of tokens entails, and (iii) are not part of the distribu�on of the tokens.

Compliance with speciﬁc rules, laws and regula�ons is of u�er importance in banking
environment. A banking ins�tu�on is obliged to set and follow high standards of opera�ons in
order to protect its stakeholders. Besides that, the reputa�on of a bank can also be severely
damaged by poor processes including KYC and AML/CFT techniques and so�ware. We will use
exis�ng tested technologies to comply with the standards and the requirements.
In KYC, for example, modern banks are s�ll playing by old rules due to the sensi�ve nature of the
procedure importance. Up un�l now, most KYC and AML procedures require front-oﬃce presence
of a customer. While automa�c biometric devices s�ll have to prove their acceptability, eﬃciency
and security in fully digital banking, players like SEB are evalua�ng op�ons of using Skype for
customer veriﬁca�on.
P2P loans are a new model in credit systems, which allow organiza�ons to establish a pla�orm
that links those looking for loans with those looking for small investments and proﬁt. Such
systems are a great way for ﬁnancial ins�tu�ons that match the lenders with the borrowers to
generate a capital-eﬃcient, credit risk free revenue stream on processing (e.g. pla�orm
maintenance, customer due diligence, scoring). We see a par�cular opportunity in cross-border
P2P lending while most of today’s pla�orms are locked into a single jurisdic�on.
According to researches done by Deloitte, the Compound Average Growth Rate (CAGR) of the
market is over 104% in the period from 2011 to 2015, with almost double the growth during the
period from 2014 to 2015. Studies also suggest that by 2021 the total P2P loan market will be over
$500 billion, with European marking being over $35 billion.
However, as all traction is to be created by customers, Polybius aims to set high standards to
ensure the security of the procedure and comfort of all parties involved. This means that our P2P
loan platform may also adopt scoring and convenient authentication mechanisms to make the
bid/oﬀer phase transparent and trustworthy, as well as being competitive and compliant with the
regulations.
Investment features for Polybius Payment Institution customers will include crea�ng investment
por�olios, managed by a Polybius strategic partner company.
The por�olios are meant to be an investment product with a customizable risk/liquidity proﬁles.
The role of Polybius P.I. will likely be limited to a referral and funds transfer payment agent to the
said strategic partner.

The tokens have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securi�es Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securi�es
Act”), and may not be oﬀered or sold in the United States or to or for the beneﬁt of US persons (as deﬁned in Regula�on S under
the Securi�es Act) unless they are so registered, or an exemp�on from the registra�on requirements of the Securi�es Act is
available. One such exemp�on allows the resale of tokens purchased for their own account and for investment purposes only by
investors who (i) are not otherwise aﬃliated with the Polybius Founda�on, (ii) have been exposed for some �me to the economic
risks that ownership of tokens entails, and (iii) are not part of the distribu�on of the tokens.

EMI
Electronic Money Ins�tu�on

Upon reaching our second milestone, Polybius will be eligible to qualify for a broader range of
instruments that will increase the ﬁnancial services oﬀered reaching more sophis�cated and
func�onal banking. At this stage, Polybius complete Electronic Money Ins�tu�on (EMI) license
will allow us to issue electronic money – something we would not be able to do with a limited P.I.
license.
According to the article 2.2 from directive 2009/110/EC of the European Parliament and Council,
“electronic money” means “electronically, including magnetically, stored monetary value as
represented by a claim on the issuer which is issued on receipt of funds for the purpose of making
payment transactions […], and which is accepted by a natural or legal person other than the
electronic money issuer”.
In XIX century, gold was used as money. In XX century, we moved on to cash for both historical and
prac�cal reasons. In XXI, money went digital, and it was rare to meet a person with a bank account
not holding a debit card. For a bank to have the right to issue cards, it must either apply for a card
scheme membership (like MasterCard, Visa or American Express), or join an already exis�ng
member of a scheme, namely BIN Principal Member A BIN Principal Member will issue the cards
for Polybius and will be communica�ng with schemes on our behalf, taking fees for processing.
Not only do bank clients need to send money, but they also need to receive it, whether to their
personal or corporate accounts. A BIN Principal Member is also responsible for money acquiring,
crea�ng a seamless both-end payment transac�on service. It may be required to have a
“prefunding account” on the side of a BIN Principal Member and it might take up to 6 months for
nego�a�ons and ﬁnal agreement.

The tokens have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securi�es Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securi�es
Act”), and may not be oﬀered or sold in the United States or to or for the beneﬁt of US persons (as deﬁned in Regula�on S under
the Securi�es Act) unless they are so registered, or an exemp�on from the registra�on requirements of the Securi�es Act is
available. One such exemp�on allows the resale of tokens purchased for their own account and for investment purposes only by
investors who (i) are not otherwise aﬃliated with the Polybius Founda�on, (ii) have been exposed for some �me to the economic
risks that ownership of tokens entails, and (iii) are not part of the distribu�on of the tokens.

EMI
At this milestone, Polybius Payment Institution will likely implement currency exchange services,
allowing corporate customers to keep a variety of currencies inside a single bank account,
exchanging them at their discre�on and making payments with less spending and vola�lity risks.
The deployment of the exchange may take up to 3 months.
By being in the middle of an online ﬁnancial transac�on we expect to gather a lot of insight into
consumer's behavioural pa�ern as well as income and liability proﬁle. This will drive our scoring
models allowing to oﬀer loans. We expect these loans to be extended predominantly to ﬁnance
purchases from online merchants we'll be working with. This will enhance the value of the membership of Polybius–Digital Pass biosphere through driving the sales for our merchants and
providing a diﬀeren�ated oﬀering for the consumers. Last but not least, it will also be beneﬁcial
to Polybius as we will maximize our return on investment by supplemen�ng interest income with
the consequen�al transac�on revenues.
Similarly to our consumers, we would like to be in a posi�on to oﬀer ﬁnancing to our merchants.
This will most likely take the shape of working capital ﬁnancing whereby we could either (a)
ﬁnance their stock or (b) allow them to provide consumer ﬁnancing by extending them a loan to
bridge a receivable. Par�cularly in the case of receivable ﬁnancing, our deal appe�te will likely be
driven by the credit scoring as well as the merchant's trade volume through Polybius. Such posi�ve reinforcement will encourage the transac�ons through our pla�orm and drive value for all
Polybius stakeholders.

The tokens have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securi�es Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securi�es

available. One such exemp�on allows the resale of tokens purchased for their own account and for investment purposes only by
investors who (i) are not otherwise aﬃliated with the Polybius Founda�on, (ii) have been exposed for some �me to the economic
risks that ownership of tokens entails, and (iii) are not part of the distribu�on of the tokens.

Commercial Bank

The strategy upon reaching this milestone greatly advances, and so do Polybius ambi�ons and
requirements. At this stage, Polybius will be eligible to reach the poten�al of a fully func�onal
bank with a complete set of features. Along with classical banking services, Polybius Bank will
deliver applica�ons and instruments required in the market. Our aim is to provide Banking as a
Service, more commonly known as BaaS.
But before the development of APIs, Polybius may apply for a card scheme (Visa/MasterCard)
Principal Member License. With such membership, no BIN sponsors would be required for card
issuing, simplifying the card payment processing and reducing the costs. The licenses allow card
issuing in all European countries. It may take up to 6 months to receive the membership.
At the same �me, Polybius will rally to become a bank, applying for an all-inclusive banking
license. This is one of the most serious licenses and requires Polybius to undergo many lengthy
audit sessions. The process may take up to 2 years, but as a result Polybius will be authorized to
provide deposit services, issue debit and credit cards and oﬀer savings accounts (e.g. re�rement
savings).
The digitaliza�on of commerce is the ul�mate requirement for modern merchants to stay
compe��ve across the market. This, however, makes the merchants dependent on third party
payment service providers to issue the services and the infrastructure for payment ini�a�on and
account informa�on services. The oﬀering of a classical bank is o�en regarded as limited and
inﬂexible. We therefore see a signiﬁcant opportunity to gain strong market share across electronic
merchants by oﬀering a nimble solu�on.

The tokens have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securi�es Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securi�es
Act”), and may not be oﬀered or sold in the United States or to or for the beneﬁt of US persons (as deﬁned in Regula�on S under
the Securi�es Act) unless they are so registered, or an exemp�on from the registra�on requirements of the Securi�es Act is
available. One such exemp�on allows the resale of tokens purchased for their own account and for investment purposes only by
investors who (i) are not otherwise aﬃliated with the Polybius Founda�on, (ii) have been exposed for some �me to the economic
risks that ownership of tokens entails, and (iii) are not part of the distribu�on of the tokens.

Commercial Bank
With the PSD2 in place, banks will have to adapt and oﬀer just the speciﬁc services required for
e-Commerce, as well as provide tools for TPPs which will come with help of new direc�ves. The
mission of Polybius Bank is to not only provide the Account Servicing Payment Service Provider
(ASPSP) services on an open pla�orm for merchants, but to also make sure that the
implementa�on and integra�on of such services comes seamlessly through the role of Polybius as
a TPP, i.e. Account Informa�on Service Provider (AISP) and Payment Ini�a�on Service Provider
(PISP) pla�orms in the frame of the PSD2.

The tokens have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securi�es Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securi�es

Digital Pass
The infrastructure of Polybius Bank project will rely on reputable exis�ng core solu�ons along
with technologies meant to digi�ze and automate opera�ons and communica�on.
Digital Pass, the product of our development, is a standalone technology and service aimed to
standardize system-to-system communica�on, and enable trust through the integrity of records.
It is designed to facilitate individuals and businesses to get access to, and to keep encrypted
personal & corporate data in a privately accessible decentralized ledger. The data will later be
used in a secure, open and non-discriminatory manner to increase the scope of Polybius Bank or
P.I. procedures, as well as to build an ecosystem for businesses in strict accordance to regula�ons
issued by the European Parliament and outlined by the European Commission.
Digital Pass employs the experience of the trusted and ﬁeld-tested Estonian e-Residency
iden�ﬁca�on system and its uses. The main principles of security, adapta�on and poten�al
appliance are outlined below:
Protec�on of personal data
The ﬁrst and most important aspect of Digital Pass features is related to the processing and
storage of data referable to the personal iden�ﬁca�on (sensi�ve), as well as anonymous and
pseudonymous informa�on. The classiﬁca�on, storage, analysis, processing and accessibility of
data will be compliant to the direc�ves set by European Commission, i.e. the General Data
Protec�on Regula�on (GDPR) and others.
Decentralised Ledger Technologies
Due to the cri�cal importance of informa�on security, the data requires an undeniable, highly
secure and redundant storage environment that will also allow private access to and exchange of
informa�on between Polybius Bank or P.I., its customers, trusted en��es and law organisa�ons.
Being compliant with the European Union direc�ves and regula�ons, Emer blockchain technology
will be adopted as a basis for further development. Among its key features, Emer oﬀers mul�-level
permission-based access to data via SSL cer�ﬁcates. En��es and organiza�ons using the trusted
environment may include, but are not limited to: ﬁnancial, health and government ins�tu�ons
along with trust-businesses. The access to data entered and retained in the trusted environment
will be provided on the individual’s discre�on or by a request from legal authori�es.
While the Emer blockchain stays as a trustable environment for data storage and access to
services and entries is covered by independent so�ware solu�ons (such as the Authorizer), there
are other DLTs (such as the Tangle) that are designed to allow an eﬃcient transfer of low batches

Digital Pass
Internet of Things
With the expansion of smart devices, smart cars and smart houses, more types of transac�ons
will eventually appear. For the IoT to func�on seamlessly, speciﬁc standards of micropayment
processing and message delivery have to be adopted for convenient M2M communica�ons and
billing.
While not being a focus area at the earliest stages of development, the poten�al and the
requirements of the ﬁeld is the reason to keep it in mind. As the technology starts to gain mass
recogni�on and adop�on, Polybius Bank or P.I. will look forward to develop and provide
instrumental payment services based, or employing currently exis�ng solu�ons.
Big Data
Digital Pass is designed to collect and store a handful of data, which will be used to enable
individuals and en��es to receive both high quality services and informa�on about the Market in
general. The informa�on may be anonymously collected by trusted, licensed and regulated
en��es and then processed, providing regional data regarding the requirements of local industry.
The data may also be used for the development of new procedures or services required in
diﬀerent areas of human life. Due to the sensi�ve nature of the data stored in Digital Pass, such
analysis will be done in the strictest regulatory conﬁdence and in full compliance with European
regula�ons.
Applied AI
Although in its infancy, ar�ﬁcial intelligence is already used as a tool of data analysis. Weak AI or
Narrow AI is complex combina�on of algorithms able to analyze big clusters of data and give
"answers" accordingly to preset logic. In ﬁnancial environment, such tool is used in scoring and
sensi�vity systems. To remove any chance of private selﬁshness in the processing of sensi�ve
informa�on, and to increase trust between customers, trusted en��es and Digital Pass, it is
crucial to ensure the correct usage of data. Along with the development of Polybius Bank or P.I.
and related services, the overall capacity, opera�onal speed and costs will be improved with the
implementa�on of applied AI solu�ons within the Digital Pass and other func�onal features.
For backers and Polybius Bank
The real value of Digital Pass lies not only within its design principles, but also within the scope of
recent regula�ons set forth in the European Union to advance the European Single Market.
By following the latest regula�ons, ﬁnancial ins�tu�ons and merchants will require secure digital
iden�ﬁca�on, authen�ca�on and authoriza�on tools to provide their customers an entry point in
the Digital Single Market.
Digital Pass is the solu�on to sa�sfy compliance with the eIDAS Regula�on and may generate
revenue on its related services, e.g. data processing and analysis. Our ini�al goal is to create a
single cross-European credit scoring system together with our strategic partners who are among
the leaders in the credit industry in Europe. Those en��es interested in using the features and
tools provided by Digital Pass will be subject to royalty and maintenance fees as to ensure the
validity and con�nuity of the service as well as proﬁtability.
The tokens have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securi�es Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securi�es

Digital Pass
Basic technical principles of opera�on:
Digital Pass combines user SSL cer�ﬁcates, blockchain-based infocards and a widely acceptable
OAuth2 technology. Current methodology of registra�on is the following:
1. User creates an infocard with private informa�on (name, address, contact details), encrypts
it and sends it over to the ledger;
2. User generates a SSL cer�ﬁcate including the infocard data, sends the info to ledger and adds
the *.p12 ﬁle to the browser;
3. User authorizes on the Digital Pass website using a cer�ﬁcate in the dashboard. User can also
use other means of authoriza�on such as an ID card, a bank or a governmental services website.
If the infocard data corresponds to data from other sources, the user is considered valid. In any
other case the data is veriﬁed by a moderator. This is a way to connect a user cer�ﬁcate with
real user data;
4. Implementa�on of Digital Pass into websites (banks, exchanges, merchants, etc) is done via
the standard OAuth2 protocol.
An illustrative use case example for a credit organization (CO):
1. User presses "authorize via Digital Pass" on a CO website;
2. The CO website redirects the user to Digital Pass website, where it authorizes using own SSL
cer�ﬁcate, receiving a User Authoriza�on Token;
3. By a following Digital Pass request, a CO website receives user's infocard data along with
veriﬁca�on data, for example:
{verified=true;verified_type:id_card}
4. Next, a CO provides a loan to a user, informing Digital Pass without disclosing any of the user's
PII.
5. Digital Pass publishes a blockchain entry with such parameters as:
name:
value:

credit_info:SSL-id
credit_org
=
"Credit Organisation Name"
credit_summ =
"Loan amount"
credit_expiration = "Loan expiration date"

Financial Marketplace
Small and Medium Enterprise Financial Marketplace
The Financial Marketplace will be the environment for ﬁntech companies and ﬁnancial experts to
present and provide the services and technologies as the product of their exper�se and development. There is a reason for such solu�ons to be in high demand - many small and medium enterprises o�en require addi�onal tools for their business to be successful and convenient, and the
market will be especially ready for such tools in the scope of the PSD2. Venture capital, seed and
angel investors also require pla�orms for their daily opera�ons, so with the development of the
Digital Pass analysis & scoring technologies accompanied by ﬁntech solu�ons we foresee the
employment of such pla�orms and instruments in the marketplace as well.
The tools will vary by purpose and mechanics, ranging from tradi�onal single market analysis
instruments to cu�ng-edge ﬁnancial aggrega�on pla�orms for loan, brokerage, insurance and
investment needs.
e-Commerce & m-Commerce services along with online merchants have to rely on third party
processors to cover their money remi�ance, compliance or logis�cs requirements. Polybius
Financial Marketplace will be designed to connect the developers and the consumers of such
technologies.
Decentralized Autonomous Organisa�ons or DAOs can be considered a new tool for Venture Capital investors as it provides secure funding mechanics using smart DLT contracts.
Same mechanisms of smart contracts and DAO tokens can also be employed in development of
smart crowdfunding pla�orms. The Ini�al Coin Oﬀering (ICO) itself is an example of a tool for the
Polybius Financial Marketplace.
With data collected in Digital Pass and analysed by third party scoring and sensi�vity systems, the
marketplace will a�ract insurance companies, credit agencies and those willing to provide access
to their informa�on. We believe that companies working with ﬁnancial risks would beneﬁt from
having a greater data input and therefore a be�er analy�cal output due to higher scoring precision. For the customers, it will mean that such services will be able to provide lower-than-usual
prices for services to compliment the readiness of individuals to share their data and ensure the
ﬁnancial and opera�onal safety.
Foreign exchange can be more than just a tool for interna�onal money remi�ance – it can become
a trading pla�orm. Corporate and individual brokers will be able to provide their services or technologies within the marketplace, while big and medium investors will access the database of
startups and established companies in need of venture capital.
