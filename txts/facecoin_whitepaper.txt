services such as filesharing and currency,
with the latest blockchain based virtual
machines able to create feature rich
applications for web services such as
exchanges, blogs, and social networking.
We believe users want to eliminate the
problems associated with centralized
services, and we want to give back the
community to the very people who create
it.

The FaceCoin
Network

Centralized social networks have the
problem of constant privacy violations
and data mining. Most people know the
phrase, "if it's free, then you are the
product being sold". Advertisers spend
billions of dollars annually to collect your
information and usage patterns on social

amounts of money to learn more about
the activities of users. Most people have
accepted the fact that their browsing

stored in a central server somewhere.
