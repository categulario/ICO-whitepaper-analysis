How it all began
In the beginning of 2017 our team of professional investors from a classic
venture market were looking into a possibility of investing in Blockchain
projects. We found out that there are a lot of promising projects, and yet few
experts from the venture market. That’s when we decided to set up a new
fund with the help of ICO. We called it FinShi Capital.
With FinShi Capital’s tokens anyone can become an investor in the
professional venture fund with large income.
Our fund is based on three pillars:
1. Classic venture funds usually greet only those investors who have at
least $500 000. While our investors will have an opportunity to work
with a professional venture fund, enjoy all the benefits and invest any
sum of money, even if they have only $1 in their wallet.
2. Every day hundreds of new projects, technologies and companies
appear on the Blockchain market and seek funding. Most of the
projects are legit, but still there is a considerable amount of scam ones.
Unprofessional investor would find it really difficult to define which
project will succeed and which one will fail. Our team, on the other
hand, does it every day, it’s our job – finding the best legit
groundbreaking projects and then investing in them.
3. When you invest in classic venture funds or directly in startups (angel
investments), you have to wait for profits for several years, because you
simply can’t get money for your share until the project is grown and
sold. As for FinShi Capital’s tokens, you will be able to sell them on
exchanges any time you want. Or, of course, you could wait for the
fund’s realization and get maximum profits. We provide all of our
portfolio startups with professional guidance, thus ensuring these
profits.

Market
The Blockchain market is growing rapidly. At the beginning of the year 2017
capitalization of the global cryptocurrency market was only 18.2 billion
dollars. In August 2017 it was 160 billion dollars. And it continues to grow.

Aggregate value of digital assets is significantly higher than Tesla’s
capitalization, it’s even higher than several countries’ GDP. This is how vast
the cryptocurrency market is.
In 2016 technological companies raised $86 200 000 000, and it’s only on
classic IPO.
FinShi Capital’s experts believe that speculating transactions and growing
number of ICO launches make the explosive growth of the cryptocurrency
market possible. We are expecting a serious market correction in the next 2
years (because it is subject to a so-called bubble effect). That’s why if you
invest together with the venture fund, you reduce the risk of making
ineffective investments in Blockchain startups.

Whitepaper v 2.2

Venture Investments Market
Venture investments have become an entrenched part of market relations. In
2016 more than 70 billion dollars were invested in the venture market in the
USA alone. 7751 IT projects were funded with this money.
Fintech and Blockchain projects are in high demand and they present the
fastest growing sector. Their market growth is 59% comparing to the previous
year.
Most of the groundbreaking projects from this sector appear in Asia, Europe
and FSU Region. We have offices in all of these regions, so there is no way we
can miss a promising Fintech or Blockchain startup.

Whitepaper v 2.2

Regulations
Most of the countries are not regulating cryptocurrency turnover and ICO in
any way. Some of the countries are just starting to frame legislation in this
sphere. Therefore, all of the investors must know that in the absence of any
regulation of the sphere they must be willing to take all the risks.
There is a risk of any of this countries introducing regulations that might lead
to significant changes and restrictions in the conditions under which the
partner invests or receives the profits. The investor must monitor the
occurrence of such changes by himself, and should they appear must take all
the risks associated with it.
Cryptocurrency is currently formally recognized as one of the liquid means of
payment only in Japan. Such countries as the USA, Canada, Switzerland and
Singapore only have some recommendations and warnings for the investors,
not full-fledged regulation.
The fund is officially located in Singapore, so it is working in compliance with
the laws of this country. In case the country introduces any specifications or
changes in the regulations over ICO or cryptocurrency, that might affect the
fund’s work in any way, we will notify all of our investors immediately.
FinShi Capital’s token FINS is a security; it implies (not guarantees) that our
investors will be receiving profits. The tokens will be issued in compliance with
MAS (Singapore) and SEC (the USA) regulations. The detailed description and
status of the token as a security can be found in the “Legal Terms” section.
Anyone can take part in FinShi Capital’s ICO, any country’s citizens, if the law
of the country permits them to do this. The only exception are Singapore
citizens – their participation in the ICO is impossible.
For some countries residents, like the USA and Canada, it is obligatory to
confirm that they have an “accredited investor” status.
And all of the investors will also have to go through KYC and ALM
identification procedures.
FinShi Capital is trying to provide all of its investors with the required
information, but we strongly recommend that each of our partners must
study his country of residence’s laws regarding cryptocurrency and hire a
professional lawyer that can help you make the most informed decision about
investing in the fund.

FinShi Capital
FinShi Capital was founded in 2017 by professional investors of the global
venture market from Capinvest 21 venture fund and a group of Asian venture
investors Asian LP.

The investment company Capinvest 21 has been operating since 2007 and has
offices in Singapore, Cyprus and Moscow. Over the past years our team has
learnt how to choose the right project for funding and has accumulated
considerable experience in managing and guiding startups. The team helps
projects with daily management, teaches them how to complete their product
development as fast as possible, and then helps them with capturing target
markets and minimizing risks. There have been a lot of different
manufacturing and service companies in the fund’s portfolio over the past 10
years (oil and gas industry, logistics, construction). But now the team is
focused on IT projects. Capinvest 21 is a partner of most of the innovative
companies (IIDF, Skolkovo, RVC, Rusnano, etc) and works together with
strategic infrastructural companies.
Our second fund, CAPINVEST 21 Grows Venture Fund II was formed to invest
in projects on A and B rounds. It contains 100 million dollars, with which our
team funds only those projects, that have proved their business model to
work and captured clients’ demand. Capinvest 21 prefers to invest in projects
from: E-commerce & Mobile, Marketplace & Aggregators, Social media, SaaS
& Smart Cloud, Advert technology.

www.finshi.capital Blockchain venture fund

Whitepaper v 2.2

Summarizing results of the previous periods, the total return of Capinvest 21
is more than 122% per annum. Our experience, reputation and
professionalism are at your service!
In FinShi Capital’s main focus are Fintech projects on seed and A/B rounds,
those that already have MVP and first clients. Investment in one project vary
from $500k to $5m. The best startups will be funded with classic venture
investments (fiat currency). We will also take part in crowdsales of some of
the selected companies.

www.finshi.capital Blockchain venture fund

Whitepaper v 2.2

The Fund's investment strategy
Around 60% of the raised funds will be spent on short-term investments in
carefully selected projects that are planning to launch their own ICOs. Up to
30% will go to long-term investments and no more than 10% will be left for
classic venture investments. Such portfolio allocation assures balance
between the risks of short-term and long-term investments. The strategy
might be changed by the management whenever there is a need to do so.

• The unused raised funds will be temporarily invested in four different
lower risk securities (conservative investing).
• Making co-investments is possible for the purpose of minimizing risks.
• Portfolio’s profits will be recalculated after each exit. The fund’s total
profits will be calculated after its realization.
In the end of August FinShi Capital was monitoring more than 70 different
Fintech-projects, some of which might be funded after the fund’s ICO. We still
continue to search carefully for more interesting projects.

www.finshi.capital Blockchain venture fund

Whitepaper v 2.2

FinShi Capital's mission
Our mission is to maximize our partners’ profits by helping new Fintech and
Blockchain companies to grow into unicorns.

FinShi Capital’s goals
In the next 2 years our team will select, fund and assure rapid growth of 15 to
30 startups. All of these startups will afterwards be sold to the next round
investors or strategic buyers. Eventually the fund will be fully realized,
investors will get their money back, 7 to 14 times more than the initial sum
they invested, and the world will get new worthy IT companies.
In our classic venture fund we ensure 120% per annum income (summarizing
the portfolio projects growth during the previous periods), so if we take into
account dynamics of Blockchain and Fintech market development, we set a
goal to have 520% per annum income.

How FinShi Capital will accomplish its goals
We have been earning money on classic venture investments for several years
now. Investments in Blockchain companies are a bit different, but the main
issues are still the same. We know these issues, and we know for sure how to
address them.
1. Projects selection. Once ICO is over, we will carefully select startups for
funding.
2. Projects growth. After we invest in the most promising projects, we will
help them to speed their development and improve their products.
3. Shares selling. When a startup reaches considerable growth, we sell our
share and get high profits.
This cycle repeats several times until all the raised funds are distributed.

Whitepaper v 2.2

Why FinShi Capital
FinShi Capital is the first blockchain venture fund formed entirely of
cryptocurrency. There are some venture funds on the market who invest in
Blockchain startups, but they use classic venture scheme and do not allow
partners invest small sums of money. Thanks to the smart contracts
technology, we can invite unlimited number of unprofessional investors to
invest together with us. So firstly, you should choose us because we make it
possible for you to become an investor of a professional venture fund with
the minimal investment of just $1.
Secondly, unlike most of the new crowdfunding and investment platforms, we
have been working in this sphere since 2007. We offer you everything we
know. We are already making good money on the venture market. Join us.
Thirdly, we know the best ways to determine which project has a chance to
succeed. Usually only 1 or 2 startups out of 100 show considerable growth.
We analyze startups every day and always see the promising ones, that’s why
our funds show good figures. Dozens of startups appear every week,
launching ICOs and seeking other ways to raise funds. Most of these projects
might eventually turn out to be scams. A private investor would never be able
to analyze and process that much data just by himself.
And finally we know what is most important – portfolio projects’
management. Most of the advisory platforms, that help you to make a
decision about an investment, do not think about the next very important
step. The pace of portfolio company’s capitalization growth depends on how
well the project is managed afterwards. The fund provides all of its portfolio
projects with advisory and proper management. It helps them with product
development, day-to-day affairs and capturing target markets, thus ensuring
the startups growth. The fund spends around 50% of its time and resources on
this, eventually, these are the things that assure high profits.

www.finshi.capital Blockchain venture fund

Whitepaper v 2.2

Why Our Tokens
1. You will be able to sell tokens on exchanges at any time.
2. The token’s value will be gradually growing after each share purchase
or sale.
3. Approximately every month you will be getting dividends – 80% of the
fund’s profits (the fund will be buying out your tokens after each exit, it
will be happening almost every month starting from the fourth quarter
of 2017).
If you bought cryptocurrency just hoping that it would grow and you would
profit from the increase in the rate, you will receive less profits than your due.
Instead of lying around in your wallets, your cryptocurrency can earn extra
money by being invested in the venture fund.
Any owner of a virtual wallet can invest in FinShi Capital and become a
shareholder of several legit promising companies.
Members of our team spent years working on the venture market, they do
not invest in projects which can bankrupt tomorrow. They know well how to
ensure high profits and make good money for themselves and for all of the
fund’s investors.

Token's Description
FinShi Capital’s ICO will be conducted in compliance with SEC and MAS’
regulations. Anyone, except for Singapore citizens, will be able to purchase
the fund’s tokens legally. However, all of the investors will have to go through
KYC/ALM procedure.
The fund’s tokens are standard ERC20 tokens, created to make profits
(securities).

How we reduce risks and increase profits
One of the main risks that investors face, both on the classic venture market
and ICO, is scam. According to experts, most of the Blockchain/Bitcoin
startups can turn out to be fraud. Nowadays dishonest entrepreneurs use
virtual economy to earn money: it is easy to invest in it, and unprofessional
investors tend to fund projects without thorough analysis and investigation.
FinShi Capital’s team has met a lot of incompetent and fraud projects over the
years of their work. That’s why for our team performing Due Diligence of each
project is a must.
Our analysts, managing partners and invited experts carefully and thoroughly
examine each project. Even startups that don’t have a working product yet,
but have an idea, founders, target markets, must be investigated. During Due
Diligence specialists verify team members’ biographies, experience, test their
business model, and if the project is already up and running, they analyze how
and why this startup is growing/making profits. We also analyze markets and
competitors in order to figure out how big certain project’s part on the target
market will be. It might take months to complete Due Diligence, but
eventually there will be a full report with all of the risks and perspectives of a
certain startup.
FinShi Capital works together with outside agencies which also perform Due
Diligence of the fund’s potential portfolio projects. They provide us with an
unbiased review of all the aspects, thus helping us to minimize the risks.
Our team are all experienced investors, their knowledge allows them to
perform a high-quality Due Diligence of each project, thus ensuring safe
investments and high profits.
And of course one of the most important things is a skilled strategic
management of each portfolio company. Smart management significantly
reduces risks.

Risks
Venture investments are highly risky. Buying FINS tokens is a considerable
risk. The investors and managers incur the following risks: inherent risk, loss
risk, theft risk, compliance risk, risk of misconception. Once the investor sends
his cryptocurrency to one of the fund’s wallets, he confirms that he
understands and accepts the risks and potential irreversible losses. The fund’s
managers only risk losing their own personal investments.
 There is no guarantee that the invested funds will be safe or will lead to
profits.
 All of your investments might be lost!
 The investments are not insured and there are no private or
government insurance representative that the investors can address.
 There is no guarantee of the token’s liquidity in the future. There is a
risk that the tokens won’t be in demand.
 There is a risk of all the fund’s assets theft by fraudsters or hackers.
 There is a risk of appearance of regulatory or legal restrictions, which
can complicate the fund’s work or stop it altogether.
 There is a risk of a fail investment, which the fund might proclaim
unprofitable and write off as a loss.
 There are technical risks (e.g. connected to Ethereum) that might cause
the fund to be unable to make a transaction of the profits.
 There is a risk of cryptocurrency, fiat currency or investment
devaluation.
 There is a corporate risk of losing control over shares of the portfolio
startup.
All legal conditions and agreements, including those for the US citizens
can be found here. All investors must read carefully and accept these
conditions and all the risks!

www.finshi.capital Blockchain venture fund

Whitepaper v 2.2

ICO structure
FinShi Capital’s ICO goal is to raise from 30 to 50 million dollars in
cryptocurrency in order to invest them in Finteck and Blockchain projects
afterwards.
We have a simple and understandable model of making money on the funds
tokens – buy-back mechanism. With the help of smart contracts FinShi Capital
will be obliged to buy out your tokens after each portfolio company’s shares
sale. It means that each time the fund profitably exits one of its startups, all of
the investors of the fund will immediately get dividends. 80% of the profits
will be yours, the fund will get 20%. So, according to this structure, the
members of FinShi team will get their profits alongside other investors, which
means that maximizing profits is in everyone’s interest. The fund will be
operating for 2 years, but the period might be changed.
Moreover, in addition to the buy-back mechanism, you will be able to sell
your tokens on exchanges at the market price any time you want. And as the
fund will start buying shares in startups straight away after the ICO, the
token’s market price will grow with each purchase. You won’t be able to find a
classic venture capital that offers an opportunity to quickly exit the fund with
your profits secured.
This model is compelling for the investors because of its liquidity and
volatility.
We are sure that classic investors, traders, venture investors, as well as
cryptocurrency owners and financial investment funds will be interested in
joining our ICO. For all of you we offer portfolio diversification and
professional guidance for each project management.
