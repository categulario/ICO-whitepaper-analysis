Overview of the GeoFounders Project
What is GeoFounders?
GeoFounders is a software collective that creates desktop, mobile and web
decentralized applications (dApps) which run atop popular blockchain platforms.
Using custom-made middleware, GeoFounder’s software can switch between
different blockchain networks and, in some cases, operate on more than one
network at the same time. This feature allows customers to not only operate
GeoFounders software on their preferred network, but also ensures the longevity of
the GeoFounders software catalogue and an increase in overall potential customers.
Once application software is created and put into operation, fees are generated
through customer usage and are collected into a distribution account. This account
can be accessed at any time by those who possess GeoFounder tokens, also called
GeoUnits (GUNS). GUNS owners may collect their portion of the earnings based on
their percentage of GUNS held versus the total fixed supply. Ten percent (10%) of all
fees generated are reserved and cycled back into the process of designing,
developing and marketing new software products and services to be added to the
collective in order to increase overall fees, users and GUNS token value.
Example: If you own 5% of the total fixed supply of GUNS, then you would be
entitled to 4.5% of all earnings.

What is the goal of GeoFounders?
Our primary goal is to create useful and productive software which leverages the
unique aspects of blockchain networks and brings substantial returns to our token
holders. Our secondary goal is to help promote the understanding and adoption of
blockchain technology and to provide software that is simple enough to use for
mainstream markets and customers.

GeoFounders Middleware
GeoFounders middleware software is a crucial part of the GeoFounders
development process and software usage. Blockchain platforms are numerous and
packed with a variety of features, some the same, some vastly different. The space is
new and therefor many experiments are being attempted to figure out which
features work best. GeoFounders middleware allows us to shield our software
catalogue from this creative chaos by acting as a bridge between the different
blockchain networks and the applications. A set of internal communication
standards has been developed which allow the applications and middleware to
interact with a common and unchanging language while, in the background, the
middleware is translating responses and requests from the applications into
responses and requests that each particular blockchain platform understands. In
essence, the middleware is acting as a reliable translator. Middleware will span
across desktop, mobile and web platforms via status bar applications, remote
middleware nodes, and web browser plugins.

GeoFounders Process Explanation
Software Creation
In the beginning, applications are developed by the GeoFounders development
team. These applications are developed specifically for use with the GeoFounders
middleware software, which acts as a bridge between the various and growing list
of blockchain platforms and the application request and response data structure.
With the use of middleware, the GeoFounders software can remain platform
agnostic.
Software Installation
Through marketing, word-of-mouth, or the GeoFounders application store, people
learn about GeoFounders software and install an application. All applications
package the GeoFounders middleware providing multiple options to the
application user. Sophisticated users may choose to use the middleware to run a
separate node for a particular blockchain platform (Ex. Ethereum) while lesstechnical users may opt to connect to a GeoFounders-hosted public remote node in
order to save time. Once connected, the users can operate the software as intended.
If the user is new to the cryptocurrency space, tutorial links and options to purchase
tokens through third-parties are provided to help them get started.
Software Usage
Once the user begins to use a particular GeoFounders application, fees are collected
for certain features. These fees are routed into an Ethereum-based distribution
account with a particular set of smart contracts. These smart contracts enable GUNS
owners to retrieve their portion of the earnings at any time.
Continued Development and Marketing
Ten percent (10%) of revenue generated by the GeoFounders software catalogue is
reserved to continue operating GeoFounders software development and marketing
in order to increase overall revenue, users and GUNS token value.

Why should people use GeoFounders software?
Although the space is relatively new and most software requires considerate
technical knowledge, the fundamental benefits of blockchain technology is
significant and will affect most, if not all, industries. GeoFounders software is lucky
enough to benefit from these inherent features, which include:

Feature

Benefit

Plain Language

Decentralization

The collective consensus of
nodes keep the system secure.

No government, corporation or
individual can take down your
data.

Immutability

Records cannot be altered
retroactively without the
alteration of all subsequent
blocks and network collusion.

Data added through the
applications can be verified as
authentic and untampered.

No or Low Fees

Transactions are typically in
place as an incentive to miners
when validating bitcoin blocks.

Processing fees are a small fraction
of what traditional banks and
financial services charge.

In addition to the built-in features of most blockchain technology, GeoFounders
software specifically provides the following benefits:

applications to be downloaded.

Custom Middleware

GeoWrap acts as a bridge
between software and
blockchain platforms.

The software runs on many
different types of blockchains: Ex.
Ethereum, Rootstock, Lisk, etc.

Multilingual

GeoFounders software will
be translated into over 25
languages.

25 languages will be supported
(over time).

Optional Remote
Nodes

Mobile and non-technical
individuals can use proxy
nodes we host.

Software can connect to the
blockchain in seconds if you trust
GeoFounders servers.

What types of applications will GeoFounders develop?
Like the mid to late 1990’s with the emergence of the Internet, we believe
blockchain technology is likely to affect every industry. Because of this belief, we are
casting a wide net and equally dividing software creation ambitions across the
Enterprise, Professional and Consumer spaces.
Below are a few of the initial first-round applications that are being developed for
the 2017-2018 product cycle:

GeoRealms 
Fantasy Adventure Game

GeoBanker 
Multi-Blockchain Wallet & Financial Tools

PubLub 
Complete Digital Publishing Ecosystem

Opify 
Business Communication Platform

How will you market GeoFounders software?
GeoFounders will use a mixture of traditional marketing techniques along with
creative solutions unique to the blockchain space. We feel there are some very big
opportunities available to us to market GeoFounders software to the public.
Blockchain technology is currently a very important and exciting topic in the
mainstream press and will likely remain so over the next few years as
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum grow and expand their influence.
Besides campaigns, partnerships and other marketing methods, the biggest driver
of new users will likely come from the application stores embedded in all
GeoFounders software and GeoWrap. Thanks to the blockchain, GeoFounder
software can easily tap into a repository of store information and present a simple
application store to all users. Another application store in development is called
GeoDapps. This application store has a similar feel to stores such as the macOS App
Store or Windows 10 App Store except it caters exclusively to decentralized
application created by GeoFounders and third-parties. It is our hope that this store
application makes it easier for people to find decentralized software and eventually
review and rate said software.

Token Mechanism
GeoFounders tokens have many uses.
GeoFounders tokens, also known as GeoUnits (GUNS), serve multiple purposes. The
first purpose is to act as a measurement of “virtual stake” regarding revenue
produced by the GeoFounders software catalogue. GUNS tokens are analyzed using
a simple formula due to the fixed nature of the GUNS supply. For every GUNS token
a person possesses, they receive 0.0000009% of the revenue generated by the
GeoFounders software collective. The more tokens you possess, the greater your
share of the revenue.
The second purpose of GUNS tokens are to act as a verification mechanism within
different GeFounder applications. Depending on the software, this authentication
process can provide different services. For example, the primary GeoFounder
members application uses token verification to allow communication within the
software while other applications provide novelty software rights, such as the ability
to name an in-game location within GeoRealms if you can verify an account with
1000 or more GUNS.

Moonshine
A Blockchain Platform for GeoFounders Software Testing
Moonshine is a separate blockchain platform currently
under development and scheduled to launch in Q4
2018. Leveraging the future GeoFounders application
catalogue, Moonshine will become the testing ground
for new applications and updates to existing products.
Moonshine will eventually receive access to GeoFounder
and partner applications before other blockchain
platforms and will provide a valuable and trusted
network for the future development and growth of the
software collective.
The underpinnings of Moonshine utilize the Ethereum codebase which provide a
solid industry-tested platform from which to launch. In addition to the Ethereum
codebase, Moonshine implements an array of modifications both unique and from
existing blockchain implementations to create an ideal platform for application
development, decentralized data storage and multi-blockchain compatibility.

Moonshine Chain
Moonshine, at it's core, provides a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, a
generic pluggable second-tier network for future expansion and the Moonshine
Virtual Machine (MVM) which borrows very heavily from the Ethereum Virtual
Machine (EVM). The Moonshine chain uses tokens called "shine". This chain secures
the network, executes smart contracts and processes all transactions on the
platform (except for second-tier middle-hops). The chain is heavily optimized to
reduce data size and maintain extremely fast transaction processing. Exploration

GEOFOUNDERS WHITE PAPER

into new pruning methods are being reviewed to possibly help reduce the size of
the blockchain further to encourage the largest number of possible nodes.

Custom Client Software
At the launch of Moonshine, GeoFounders will release custom client software. This
software will embed the features of GeoWrap and GeoDapps to create a universal
client application with both curated and uncurated decentralized app store
functionality. The design of the client software will focus on ease-of-use for
mainstream non-technical participants while still allowing advanced panels for
power-users, including a built in scripting capability for node macros. Relays and
plugins will be pluggable within the client software.

Relays
Relays are used as 2-way pegs which enable exchange with other blockchain
platform tokens. Relays are kept purposely minimal and will likely rely on an array of
federated nodes to maintain a 2-way peg with other networks. Relay nodes use the
Moonshine second-tier network to reduce blockchain bloat and enable flexible
interactions without concern to the main chain. New relays are incrementally added
based on demand and the available external resources for each platform.
Moonshine will leverage existing relay codebases to accelerate the initial
development of relays for the most popular networks.

GeoFounders Involvement
Moonshine will not have an Initial Coin Offering. The initial Moonshine supply will be
exclusively available to GeoUnit token (GUNS) holders. A call for token requests will
be held on November 1, 2018 where an Ethereum smart contract will verify requests
for Shine tokens based on GUNS ownership. If requested, the GUNS owner will
receive a 1:1 ratio of Shine tokens which will be built into the genesis block of the

GEOFOUNDERS WHITE PAPER

11

Moonshine platform. The initial Moonshine token supply will be based on the final
request tally.

Purpose of Creation
The Moonshine network is being developed as a test network and alternative
platform for the GeoFounders application catalogue. Although existing blockchain
platforms provide excellent networks, it will be important for GeoFounders to have
influence and access to it's own network. The network can be used as a means for
securing the future of GeoFounders applications as well as ensuring platform-level
update capabilities, if needed, without fear of stagnation or resistance from
economically opposed entities. GeoFounders software will continue to run on all
other supported networks without change.

Existing Resources
Moonshine is built upon a foundation of existing code, protocols and concepts. The
majority of the features within the platform exist in some form or fashion on current
networks. The goal and challenge for Moonshine is to combine these technologies,
many of which are written in different programming languages, into a single, new
and functional test network.
Moonshine is still in early development. The initial codebase will be committed to
the GeoFounders GitHub account on March 1, 2018 after the development reaches
v0.1. The first Moonshine client is being developed in Rust with plans on porting to
other languages as development progresses.

Long-Term Objectives
The long term objectives of GeoFounders are as follows:
•

Create Highly Useful and Productive Software 
 
We want to eradicate the “what can you do with it” argument related to
blockchain software. Our primary goal is to create software that people prefer to
use and enjoy, and we believe blockchain networks can help us achieve this goal.
An always available, economically plugged-in, decentralized data store network
makes our software much more powerful than a proprietary centralized system
in most scenarios. We intend to exploit every advantage as it relates to
blockchain features. 

•

Change Industries 
 
We love niche software that accommodates a specific group of users but the
most exciting software are those which can change the way people
communicate, work or stay organized. This is why we are working on applications
such as Opify and PubLub. We want to use the blockchain to disrupt entire
industries and change the way things are done. Thankfully this technology gives
us that opportunity to attempt just that. 

•

Create Value for Those Who Put Their Faith In Us 
 
We are laser-focused on creating value for our token holders. We want GeoUnits
to be a premium token that people wish to hold long term and collect earnings
from. This is why our initial development cycle include multiple methods of
discovering, installing and launching new applications and why many of our
applications have very clear and defined paths to fee collections that benefit
both the users of the software and our token holders.

primary distribution contracts and token management software operate. We felt
separating the concerns across platforms would make management and
coordination untenable.

Use of Crowdsale Funds

GEOFOUNDERS WHITE PAPER

16

Funds that are raised will go towards the following for GeoFounders:
Team Leads:
The current ratio of team lead versus application is 1:4. Additional trusted team
leaders would be added to GeoFounders to lower the ratio to 1:2 and for some of the
more ambitious applications 1:1.
Design:
A few reliable professional designers will be brought in-house to expedite the
creation of game assets and to improve user experience and interface design across
all applications.
Marketing & Public Relations:
We intend for version 1.0 of our product catalogue to compete with mainstream
products in the market. To accomplish this task we will utilize a combination of
traditional and unique marketing campaigns to get the word out. Campaigns will
remain within very tight budget constraints.
Business:
The blockchain space is extremely new, enabling many potential development and
partnership opportunities.
Capital Reserve:
Some capital will be kept in reserve for bootstrapping the initial application
catalogue development. A portion of the funds are allotted for potential acquisition/
acqui-hire opportunities and group opportunities that benefit the entire collective.

GeoFounders Token Holder Payout
More Details Regarding GUNS Payouts
Distribution:
Distribution is determined based on GUNS ownership, with 10% of revenue alloted
towards continued development. Example: If you own 5% of the total GUNS supply
then you will receive 4.5% of the collected profits.
Non-Ethereum Payouts:
Tokens collected on non-Ethereum platforms will be liquidated on a bi-weekly basis
into ETH and transferred into the collective distribution contract. Members have the
option to use the GeoFounder application (ETA October, 2017) to specify accounts
for other platforms and have their earnings in these tokens routed to their native
accounts instead of liquidation.
Autonomous Collections:
GeoFounders utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to hold GUNS token holder
earnings until their request. Due to the nature of smart contracts, funds are not
routed to accounts and instead must be requested by the token holder.
Manual or Periodic Collections:
Some GeoFounders software will have manual or semi-manual fee collection
processes. When necessary, funds collected through this process will be transferred
to a trusted oracle, then liquidated and routed to the GeoFounders distribution
contract.
Transparency:
Transparency will be employed regarding any interactions with GeoFounders funds
not immediately visible in the blockchain.
