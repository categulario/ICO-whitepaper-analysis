ABSTRACT
Almost 2.5 billion people on Earth use some form of social
networking. Account data is harvested, and accessed by large
corporations every day.
Nexus is a new generation of social network. All data and
uploads will exist on the blockchain instead of centralized
servers. Nexus is a feature rich platform that allows you to
communicate with friends and family in multiple different and
unique ways, while providing state-of-the-art security and
privacy.
By decentralizing and encrypting all data and uploads,
Nexus hopes to eliminate all invasion of privacy that
large corporations are currently performing. End-to-end
message encryption ensures only you and the person you’re
communicating with can read what is sent, and nobody in
between, not even Nexus. Imagine a full decentralized social
network where all data and multimedia is stored on the
blockchain instead of centralized servers.
The network will contain its very own native cryptocurrency
to be used for all purchases, called Social. SCL can be used to
buy goods and services from other users, purchase ad spaces
from the integrated ad platform, donate to crowd funding
campaigns, and much more.
Nexus will create a gateway between Social coins and the real
world by offering an instant access debit card that can be used
almost anywhere on Earth.
Be a part of history by participating in the Initial Coin Offering.
By getting in early, you’ll have the chance to be the first in
the world to hold Social coins. As more users join Nexus, the
demand for Social will increase, while the total amount of
coins will never exceed 50 million.
Nexus is giving the power back to the people.

WHAT ARE
SOCIALS?
Social aims to be the native
cryptocurrency coin/token
for Nexus. Social coins will be
used throughout the Nexus
marketplace and to buy and
sell goods and services.

WHAT IS
NEXUS?
Nexus is a social network
built on modern technologies
that also integrates popular
features of e-commerce and
crowdfunding. The network
primarily concentrates on
privacy, control of settings,
security and listening to the
voice of the community.
Nexus is a platform that is
already available to the public
to sign up and use on iOS,
Android and the web.
Web: https://nexus.social,
iOS: https://bit.ly/nexus-ios-app,
Android: https://bit.ly/nexus-android-app

Nexus ICO White Paper – Social Coins

Socials will also be used
within the integrated Nexus
ad platform. Impressions and
clicks will be exchanged for
Socials. These ads will be
displayed within the user’s
news feed. The Nexus ad
platform will aim to be a far
more affordable advertising
method than other networks.

MARKET
Nexus will target two major markets: social and e-commerce. Both markets are multibillion-dollar
industries that are currently controlled by large corporations.
Nexus, along with its Social coins, hopes to create a decentralized social network paired with an
online marketplace and much more.
Market Statistics
Social media advertising spend is projected to reach nearly $36 billion globally in 2017, with the
U.S. and Canada spending the most and eclipsing $12.5 billion in 2016.
E-commerce sales is expected to grow almost 12% in the next few years. Global retail ecommerce
sales will reach $1.915 trillion in 2016, accounting for 8.7% of total retail spending worldwide. 71%
of shoppers believe they will get a better deal online than in stores.
Number of social media users worldwide
from 2010 to 2021 (in billions)

Number of digital buyers worldwide from
2014 to 2021 (in billions)

FUNCTIONALITY
Multi-Wallet
Nexus account wallets will be able to hold and store any
Ethereum ERC20 standard token.
ShapeShift.io integration will allow users to convert between
tokens seamlessly straight from their Nexus account.
Functionality will include converting Socials between
ShapeShift supported ERC20 standard tokens or buying Socials
directly with other ERC20 tokens. The Nexus account wallet is
planned for launch early 2018.

Nexus ICO White Paper – Social Coins

Marketplace

Debit Card

Nexus is a social platform
that incorporates e-commerce
functions. In simple terms,
you can create a “product
post” that represents a
good or service. Friends and
followers can see this and
then purchase it directly with
their Socials.

The Nexus debit card will
connect directly to the user’s
account wallet.

For example, if you wanted to
sell your old laptop. You would
simply take a few pictures of
it, attach a title, description,
optional location and your
price in Socials. Depending on
whether you set your product
post as public or private,
other users around the world
will be able to search for it via
keywords and/or location.

The debit card will allow users
to spend their Social coins as
fiat currency anywhere in the
world. Fees will be minimal
and as the card uses Visa
infrastructure you can use it
almost anywhere in the world.
Seamless Apple Pay and
Android Pay integrations will
follow shortly after.
The instant access debit card
will cost approximately $10 in
SCL to order the physical card,
and approximately $2 in SCL
to generate a virtual card for
Apply Pay or Android Pay.

If a user decides to purchase
your good or service, they can
simply click the “Purchase”
button attached to the post,
and Socials are automatically
transferred from their Nexus
account wallet, directly to
yours. Simple as that!
The marketplace is already
a working demo that exists
within both the mobile
applications and the web
platform. The automatic
purchasing functionality
will be developed after
the integration of the user
account web wallet in Q2 2018

Nexus ICO White Paper – Social Coins

Tor & VPN
Integration
By integrating the Tor API to
our mobile applications, we
hope to keep Nexus a secure
and private social network.
Tor functionality will be opt-in
and only used by the account
if requested.
We also have plans to use
a built-in VPN within both
mobile apps that can be
paired with Tor to offer
extreme browsing privacy
while using Nexus.

Crowdfunding
The Nexus platform also
incorporates crowdfunding
posts and functionality, called
“Funds”. Any user has the
ability to create a fund post
for a specific cause alongside
an image, description, and
goal. Other users on Nexus
can then donate Socials to the
fund post and have their name
displayed as a donator to that
post.
The fund posts are currently
operational within Nexus. The
donation functionality is not
yet automated as it is waiting
on the integration of Social
coins to the Nexus platform.
Fund posts will be operational
at the same time as product
posts.

Decentralization
Nexus plans to go completely
decentralized by utilizing
already existing blockchain
applications. All data and
multimedia uploads will be
stored on the blockchain by
the end of 2018, as stated in
our roadmap.

Friends & Followers
Nexus has developed a unique
way to develop connections
within the network. Any user
can follow any other user,
although if the required user
has “approvals” turned on,
the follow request will not be
initiated until it is approved.
If user A follows user B, and
then user B follows user A
back, this then becomes a
friendship. Friendships are
more powerful connections on
Nexus and they allow for more
functionality such as instant
messaging, faster searching,
tagging and much more.

Image Editor
Nexus incorporates an
advanced image editor that
is available both online
and through our mobile
applications.
Our editor allows for all
kinds of adjustments such as
cropping, rotating, zooming,
panning, flipping and even
adding photo filters.
Each of our photo filters was
handpicked and designed to
ensure a variety of different
styles to match your personal
preference.

Nexus ICO White Paper – Social Coins

Instant Messaging
Messaging is a feature that
almost every social platform
incorporates these days.
Nexus wants to take it one
step further and offer mini
features within the instant
messaging functionality.
While chatting with a friend
you’ll also have the ability
to send Socials instantly to
them, request Socials, send
multimedia attachments
(images, GIFs, videos), emojis
and much more. We also
plan on allowing the sending
and receiving of other ERC20
standard tokens through
instant messages.
Instant messages are the
most used feature within a
social networking platform, so
Nexus hopes to make it more
enjoyable and sociable for its
users.
Nexus hopes to integrate endto-end message encryption.
This ensures only you and the
person you’re communicating
with can read what is sent,
and nobody in between, not
even Nexus.

Mobile Applications
Nexus is available for
download on both the iOS App
Store and Google Play Store.
All features available on the
web platform are also within
both mobile applications.

The mobile apps have the
ability to store your username
and password securely in the
devices encrypted storage for
easy and painless logins. Both
apps vary in download size
depending on the device, but
on average are less than 10MB
to install

Privacy
We ensure that users have full
control over both their data
and accounts privacy. This is
why we have created two very
basic privacy settings within
your account.
Visibility: Whether or not
you would like your profile
displayed publically.
Approval: Whether you would
like to approve each user as
they request to follow you.

Account Types
Nexus has created an account
type for both personal users
and businesses. Upon signing
up, users are prompted to
select an account type that
best suits them.
Business accounts consist of
slightly different settings,
while personal accounts are
best aimed for the average
every day user.
Users can switch between
account types at any time
simply from their account
settings page.

Both versions are compatible
with push notifications so that
you receive updates directly
to your phone in real time.

Additional Features
If you want to know all the
ins and outs of Nexus, we
recommend creating an
account. The platform has
much more to offer such as
events, groups, filtering, GIF
libraries, custom emojis, user
tagging, hash tagging, and
much more.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
Instant Access Debit Card
We will use a technique called JITF (Just in Time Funding). Here’s a breakdown on how an entire
transaction will work using the Nexus debit card:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.

User is issued a physical or virtual Nexus debit card that is linked to their account wallet
Card contains $0 at all times
User swipes card to pay for a purchase
Transaction is sent to our server
Server checks which fiat currency is requested (USD, AUD, EUR)
Nexus checks if user account wallet contains enough Social (SCL) to make the purchase
SCL is then sold for requested fiat
Fiat is moved to the debit card
Transaction is approved
Card balance is back to $0

The debit card will be built on Visa infastructure and will integrated with a Nexus back end API
for all transactions.

Blockchains
The Nexus platform will utilize multiple existing blockchains for SCL transfers, data storage and
multimedia uploads.
TRANSFERS
As SCL is an ERC20 based Ethereum token, it is only logical that Ethereum will be used for all
transactions within the marketplace, ad platform, crowdfunding, token swapping, and all other
related currency transfer features.
All marketplace purchases will be first sent through a master account controlled by Nexus, the
3% fee taken, and then rest forwarded to the sellers address. Both TX fees will be absorbed by
Nexus, not the seller.
MULTIMEDIA UPLOADS
As of current, the team plans on utilizing Storj for all multimedia uploads and storage. Storj
now allows for video and audio streaming over the blockchain which will be very beneficial to
a social network like Nexus. This decision may change before implementation as development
for decentralized storage is not planned until mid 2018 and new blockchain based multimedia
storage applications are being released often.
DATA STORAGE
Database storage will rely on BigchainDB. After investigating multiple blockchain based data
storage option, we found that BigchainDB had the best technology, fastest blockchain write
speeds and seamless integrations. As stated above, the decision of this may change before
implementation if a better decentralized database solution arises.

Nexus ICO White Paper – Social Coins

11

VPN
The built in VPN will be opt-in only and available within the iOS and Android applications only,
not the web version of Nexus. The functionality will be an integrated client and will rely on
the open source OpenVPN. The decision of which open source application to utilize may change
before implementation.

Tor
Tor offers multiple different integration solutions such as their open source packages (Orbit),
router API, Tor Browser, and much more. We plan on implementing features from Tor slowing to
make sure that they benefit our users instead of disturbing them. We will first offer a beta for a
Tor Browser integrated client to see how that goes with the community.

Multi-Wallet
Each user on Nexus will be assigned a multi-wallet that supports all ERC20 based tokens. The
wallet will rely on Ethereum’s open source Web3 project for transfers and signing transactions.
Users will not have the ability to export their private key. This is a feature that we may allow in
the near future.

Ad Platform
The Nexus ad platform will be semi-automatic and self-serve. Any user with a Nexus account and
SCL balance above 0 can create and submit an ad campaign through the platform.
All submited campaigns will be manually approved by Nexus support staff before going live on
the network to ensure quality and compliance. All costs will be in SCL, and will be based on CPC
(cost per click) and CPI (cost per impression).
The ad platform will show very basic metrics on first launch and may expand on this in the near
future.
Ads will not be target specific on first launch, although we do have plans to improve this in the
near future.

Coin Distribution
95% of all coins are available for purchase during the ICO. A maximum of 5% of the total
supply of coins will be given to promote the product via multiple forms of digital marketing
and development.
Zero tokens will be distributed to the Nexus team, instead, we will be implementing a “buyback” program (see below). This will highly reduce the probability of a day one exchange
dump that happens to most new tokens that hit the market.
No coins are offered for bounties as all bounty payouts are in BTC.
Here is a breakdown on where all coins will be:
Nexus team
0 SCL
Marketing campaigns
2,500,000 SCL
Pre & Main ICO
47,500,000 SCL

Buy-Back Program
Instead of allocating X amount of SCL to the team during the ICO period, we will be
launching a buy-back program on the exchange. This way, SCL will be purchased with BTC
instead of being allocated free of charge to team members.
A total of 5% of all SCL in circulation will be purchased back during the first 24 hours to help
SCL enter a bullish trend.

Unsold Coins
Our smart contract is set to only create (mint) coins/tokens as it accepts ETH. Therefore,
there will be no unsold coins remaining after the ICO has been finalized.

Minimum Goal
We have strategically set a minimum funding goal for the crowdsale. If the minimum goal is
not set, full refunds will be made via the smart-contract.
If the main ICO does not pass the minimum specified, all remaining pre-ICO funds are
returned to the investors minus marketing expenses.

WHY CONTRIBUTE
The number of Social coins is limited to 50,000,000 and no further coins can be created due to
the strict laws of smart-contracts.
All coins sold within the pre-ICO and main ICO will be the only Socials ever in circulation. Once
Nexus is complete and integrates Social coins inside the marketplace, the demand of Socials will
increase, as more people demand it as a form of payment for their goods and services.
Due to our “buy-back” program, the chances of SCL entering a bullish market once it hits an
exchange is high. If the bullish trend sticks, the price of SCL should increase steadily.
Bonus rates are offered for every period of the ICO. This means that participating during the
ICO, the contributor will recieve the base rate of 1 ETH = 500 SCL plus the current bonus in
effect.

16

Nexus ICO White Paper – Social Coins

Ad Platform
Nexus plans to integrate a fully functional and semi-automatic ad platform
in Q3 2018. The ad platform will allow users to create ads that are displayed
within the news feed. All ad spaces will cost an amount in Socials that is yet
to be determined. Charges will cost per impression and per click and will
automatically deduct the amount in Social from the accounts web wallet.

On-Selling
All Socials that Nexus makes via the marketplace fees and ad spaces will be
on-sold via the Nexus website.
Socials will be sold for ETH, BTC or via USD from a credit card. The rate of
socials will be the last seven days high +2%. This will ensure the constant
price rise of Socials.
All ETH and BTC raised from fees on Nexus will only be liquidated when the
business requires further funds.

Contributing Rules
There are strict rules and precautions to follow while participating within the Socials ICO.
• Send ETH from your personal Ethereum wallet (such as MyEtherWallet, Metamask,
Parity, Mist or Ledger).
• Set Limit to 200,000.
• Do not send funds from exchanges like Coinbase, Poloniex etc.
• Do not send your funds before the crowdsale has begun.
• SCL will be sent immediately to the wallet from which the ETH arrived.
Before contributing to the ICO, please make sure you have read and agreed to our
“crowdsale agreement” document found below.
https://ico.nexus.social/pdfs/legals/Nexus-Crowdsale-Agreement.pdf

Exchanges
Nexus has prepared all required documentation to be listed on exchanges. We are
currently talking with a few exchanges and plan to be listed on at least one major
exchange shortly after the finaliztion of the ICO.
