Synopsis
Prospectors is the first of its kind economic, multi-player, real-time strategy with real
trading and economic relations. Game events happen in a virtual world that resembles Earth in
the middle of the 19th century, in the epoch of the initial capital formation.
News has spread about rich gold-fields in the uninhabited northern lands. It has intrigued
a huge number of adventurers in search of fast personal gain. Caravans of gold miners are
headed northwards, taking their families with them and leaving their homes abandoned. Gold
dealers, moneylenders, traders, and various gentlemen of fortune are making their way.
However, it turns out that there are not many land parcels with significant gold deposits,
so not every prospector will be able to stake a rich claim. One can grow rich, however, not only
by sifting gravel for gold or finding a goldmine. The north is a land of unlimited opportunities,
covered by thick forests and earth, full of iron and coal.
Besides, one should not forget that miners need tools, which must be produced and sold
to them. From the temporary mining colonies, big towns will grow with time, and they will need
capable hands to build and develop them. Thus, there is a big need for a workforce in the
game. Everyone can find work to his liking: work in the mines, at construction, felling the trees,
or starting industrial development, including the processing of raw materials or manufacturing
tools and transport.
The thing that starts as a gold rush should grow into complex trade and economic
relations with time, so players who have skills in finance and accounting will also be able to
realize their potential.

Goal
To create an alternative reality in the form of the blockchain-based economic
strategy with game-time monetization.

Objectives
The primary task before our team is creating a Massive Multiplayer
Online Real- Time Economic Strategy (MMORTES) that will use a game
crypto-currency. The distinguishing characteristic of Prospectors,
which is absent in any other existing online game, will be the
possibility of monetizing the time spent in the game. In other words,
players will be able to not only enjoy the game but also to earn
from it, as well. One will be able to convert the gold made in the
game into real money.
The Prospectors game world will be based on the actual
economic model of the second part of the 19th and early 20th
centuries. To implement the real economic processes and
plausible financial models, our team consulted the leading
experts in the field.
We plan to launch the web version of the game platform and
the mobile apps for Android/iPhone, which will provide the players
with the access to the game anywhere, anytime.

Project Structure
The contract will create gold tokens—220 million coins in total. This number is not
accidental; it is the approximate amount of all the gold on Earth, which also includes the
unextracted gold. All tokens will be sent to the Fund of New Lots.
The Fund of New Lots is a fund where the gold, hidden in the game’s land parcels, will be
stored. 33% of the fund balance will be provided to the game server and randomly
distributed among the lots in the game.
Later on, additional game servers will be created, and, correspondingly, the gold will be
provided to them also. The possibility of server cooperation will be created, as well.
The players can extract the gold. With the help of multiple game assets (created personally
or by other players) and workers on the land lots, a player will be able to mine gold. For
registration and further usage, a player will be charged a fee that goes to the State.
The State is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where the members of
Council are the gold owners. The State has a budget; the Council has the right to influence
its formation and usage. Players’ taxes fill the budget, and afterward it is distributed
between the following funds: Fund of New Lots, Fund of Development and Expenses,
Fund of Rewards for Voting, and Fund of Destruction.

https://prospectors.io

Organizations
Players can unite within the organization. When there is consensus among players,
the game will create an organization that will belong to the players. Through voting and
consensus, players will be able to choose, and afterward change (if necessary) the
management of the organization. They will also provide the management with certain
authorities and some amount of gold. The organization can operate this amount in the game
and divide it as income between the members according to their shares.

Token
Gold (PGL) is a token and also the main currency of the game, necessary for
interaction between players; it can only be earned in the game. The amount of gold is limited
to 220 million coins.
Half of the gold, 110 million of all tokens, is put into the game and can be extracted in
parts.

https://prospectors.io

6

60 million PGL have been allocated to the crowdfunding campaign; another 50 million PGL
tokens have been allocated to the team of developers, pre-sale, and the Bounty program.
The tokens allocated to the team of developers will be frozen for five periods—20% in half
a year and the other 80% in four years (20% per year). All the tokens that were unsold
during the crowdfunding campaign will be sent to the fund of the game.
Token-holders will influence the regulation of token inflation, as they will be able to set
tariffs for the range of goods and services from the State, thus providing a balance. Also,
the bulk of tokens collected from the players by the State as a tax will be burnt.

Short Description of the Game
Goal
Get as much gold as possible, which will require different game assets and workforces.
Gold
Gold (PGL) is the main game currency, which serves as a tool for financial relations in the
game.
Whenever a worker extracts gold from a plot, the complexity of extraction increases. With
each subsequent effort, the amount of gold extracted decreases until full depletion of the
field. To increase the extraction of gold, the player must interact with game technologies
that are specially provided for this purpose.
In the game, gold will be needed for improvement of the account, remuneration of outside
workers, trade, and payment of State fees. If the player wants to develop faster, he will
need gold.

https://prospectors.io

Player’s Account
Every player has three workers with some initially specified skills. They can be sent to
work on the player’s lot, for example, washing gold. Or a player can offer the workers’
services (according to his skills) to anyone willing to hire them, or he can attend a labor
exchange, where he can hire additional workers.
A player has a right to stake any claim, anywhere, and with any aim (if this claim is free).  
A player can sell, exchange, or grant any of his own movable and immovable properties to
any other player. To facilitate selling and buying of properties, exchanges will be created.

Worker
A worker resides on the lot. Any worker’s movements on the map take some time.
Accordingly, the bigger is the distance, the longer it takes.

A worker has:
1. The speed of movement
2. The speed of work.
3. Stamina (the maximal time of work without rest)
n addition, a worker will receive the record of
service (for the time spent for work, a player will
receive certain points). The charged points can be
distributed of the player’s own accord. A player
can develop two approaches in parallel:
developing knowledge (needed for fulfilling certain
work) and a directly influencing a worker’s
performance (the speed of movement and
work, the stamina and capacity).

Game World
Everything in this world of alternative reality is situated on the map. Every player
can view everything that is happening there: who registers which new lots, what is being
built, etc. In addition, the map can show the location of visible raw materials (wood,
water, clay, and stone).
One can also choose a free lot for registration or check what belongs to whom on the
map.

Land Parcel
Everything that is located on a parcel is a property of that parcel. If nobody owns a
parcel, then everything on it is correspondingly common and can be taken by anyone.
Any player can stake a claim on the map (if a lot is free) and use it as he wishes by virtue
of rental and tax payments. In the case of non-payment, a lot can be restricted (all works
on the lot are forbidden), and sanctions can be imposed. And in the case of failure to pay
the penalty, the lot will be confiscated. (It lapses to the government if the penalty is equal
to the approximate value of the lot and all the immovable property on it) and will be sold
on the real estate exchange.
One can construct a building on a lot and work in various approaches according to the
tenant’s wish and the technology available.

Raw materials are situated on the lot. If one has the right to the land, he automatically
has the right to extract raw materials. In addition, raw materials can be processed for
further usage in other branches of industry.

https://prospectors.io

At the moment, the following kinds of raw materials are known, divided into visible and
invisible:
Visible:
•

wood

•

stone

•

clay

•

water

Invisible:
•

gold

•

ironstone

•

coal

Fields of work:
•

Extraction

•

Building

•

Production

•

Commerce

Technology – is knowledge that a worker can possess to fulfill a particular work. A
worker must possess certain skills to fulfill some kind of work. Some knowledge is built-in
by the system, and everything else a player can choose at the beginning of the game.
During the game, a player will be able to additionally develop his workers.

Material is a product of the treatment and processing of raw materials needed to
construct buildings and make products. The processing is carried out in particular buildings
with the use of the workers’ labor.

https://prospectors.io

10

Buildings – can be built only on a land lot that has a required size and is possessed by
a player himself. Every building has a certain size. Buildings can be divided into several
types: extraction, processing, production, etc. To carry out building works, the workers
must possess builders’ skills. They need a diploma, which can be received in the Academy
(from the State). Players must have a project for the building they want to erect.

Products are the result of the workers’ labor, produced in a particular building of certain
materials. A product allows a worker to fulfill a certain type of work or to work more
efficiently.

PRODUCT MANUFACTURING

https://prospectors.io

12

Alliances

– are associations of people, united by some conditions for ommunication,

acquaintance, or further creation of commercial organizations.
There are two types of alliances:
Closed – entry only by invitation
Open – free entry.

Joint Commercial Organizations are organizations that belongs to several
players. They can have a head, gold, and any other movable and immovable properties.
They can hire workers, rent land lots, erect buildings, etc
•

The management is chosen by voting.

•

The creation of organizations happens by achieving consensus among players.

•

The income of organizations will be divided between the players according to the
percentage of gold (or other property) contributed to the organization.

Banks are buildings (technology) that can be owned by players or organizations. Banks
can provide loans (with or without the security of any property), take deposits, and pay
interest to depositors.

Stores are buildings (technology) that can be owned by players or organizations. The
owner can sell implements or raw materials from his lot. The price of the wares will be set
by the store owner himself.

Transport
For the effective movement of materials through the map, transport is needed.
•

Hand-barrows can carry a few materials or anything else.

•

Carts can carry larger amounts of materials or anything else.

•

A big cart can carry plenty of materials or anything else.

The transport concept can be improved or changed.

Railways are a kind of transport that can convey great amounts of materials or
anything else at very high speed. The only drawback of this kind of transportation is that
a railway can deliver wares only to the railway stations. However, for the long distance
transportation, it is very profitable and economically effective.

Development and plans for the future
The initial idea was to develop the server part of the game based on the Ethereum
platform, but today we understand that this is not economically expedient; also, this
platform is not fast enough to perform the intended tasks. It is unacceptable to require the
player to pay for each action in the game and then make him wait for this action. The
player should be able to play for free and enjoy the process as much as possible, so the
lion’s share of money will be allocated to such things as graphics, music, and interface.
At the first stage, we will develop a web client for the gaming platform and mobile apps for
Android and iOS. We also plan to use the Unity platform. The server part at this stage will
be centralized and will be developed in the GO programming language.
The second stage is migration of the server part of the game to a decentralized platform,
based on third-party technologies. As we look to the future implementation of these plans,
we consider several options such as:

IOTA

EOS

Bitshares

The selection of a decentralized platform will be decided later.

Conclusion
In the end, one should mention that our team devotes the biggest part of our time to
creating the economic model for the game balance supply. We use real instruments to calculate
the game assets, taking into account the number of materials used and time spent for their
creation. A team of developers uses real data and adapts them to the game. Our game is very
extensive, and not all of its aspects are covered in detail in this document. However, we clearly
understand the directions of development and the limits of our capacities.
